If you go out to the Genesis web site, I think you will see a completely different type of experience. Just like Infiniti, Lexus and Acura changed the way people looked at Asian cars, Genesis dealers aren't Hyundia dealers. Granted there are no Genesis only dealerships yet, but when Rich and I went and looked at a Genesis G80, the treatment was miles a head of what you get at the Kia or Hyundia salespeople.

It had nice decor and everything, but the experience wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the same as my local BMW dealer. It was polite, but you could still feel primary focus on sale and closing, not the product exposition and its potential fit into your life, which I felt at BMW, Audi, or even Volvo stores, every time I visited those. Something you expect at a good Toyota dealership. The difference is subtle, but perceptable. It\xe2\x80\x99s mostly in the types of conversations you have with the salesman, or the manager, if he/she introduces themselves. After the visit I even received generic template follow up emails from two different managers, even though I made it clear to the sales guy the product was not interesting to me (I was looking at CT200h and it was a total dog, real disappointment).

It certainly looks better than the Accord or Camry, and I suspect the handling and braking criticisms may be due to the selection of hard low rolling-resistance tires by VW. One thing I fail to undertand is how VW can take a 2L engine, turbocharge it, and end up with 174HP when other makes routinely get around 80-100HP more by doing that.'","b'show previous quotes\nThe 2018 Passat got a mixed review from Motor Trend recently.

For 3k more than an Accord EXL it offers some significant things above an Accord in terms of the steering, transmission, brakes, interior design and quality, etc. Although I've gotten somewhat used to the style of the new 2018 Accord, I still think the TLX looks better from every angle.\n\nThe A4 is also a very nice design, and the Audi is maybe the best-looking entry-level luxury car right now imho. The TLX is close, but I do think that the Acura calipers on the front grill are maybe a bit too large, like it's trying a little too hard? I'm getting used to it, but I think the styling details on the Audi are very nice.\n\nI guess the real bargain for leasing when it comes to entry-level luxury cars is the ILX, which is basically the fanciest and most powerful 2015 Civic ever. Still, with a lease price of c. $200 a month it's a good deal for the money.

b'August 4',b'benjaminh',"b'With destination the starting price for an Acura TLX is $33,995.

But some people put the A4, 320i, and ES350 in a higher category than the TLX.\n\nFor the entry-level model TLX probably some are cross-shopping the Accord EXL 1.5, which has an msrp with destination of about $31k. So one way to look at it would be what does the TLX base have that makes it worth $3000 more than an Accord EXL.\n\nHere\'s my very subjective valuation of what the added features and qualities of the TLX are worth to me personally over an Accord EXL....\n\nThe exclusive 4-wheel steering of the TLX would be worth to me as an option at least $1200. The 4WS really helps make the steering better, from parallel parking, to medium speed cornering, to higher speed lane changes. Great system imho.\n\nThe 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter is worth at least $800 to me compared to the Accord\'s CVT.\n\nThe better suspension of the TLX compared to the Accord is worth at least $500 to me.\n\nThe quieter ride of the TLX is also worth about $500 to me.\n\nThe TLX\'s better and bigger brakes with their ""Premium Bosch 6-piston brake modulator"" another 500. Plus the ten spoke wheels look better to me on the TLX than the strange designs found on the Accord.\n\nThe longer Acura warranty\xe2\x80\x944 year bumper to bumper, and 6 year/70,000 mile engine and transmission is also worth maybe 500 to me. And the fact that they threw in 2 years of maintenance in a much nicer waiting area reinforces that.\n\nThe nicer interior parts all throughout the inside the TLX, and the more interesting and better-looking to me sheetmetal outside is worth at least another 1000, and maybe twice that.\n\nVery subjectively to me then the TLX does seem to be ""worth"" c. 5000+ more than a comparable Accord, making the added cost of 3k seem like a good deal.

Although it might be that the great deal I got was only available at this time for the significantly improved 2018 TLX. The 2017 TLX iirc lacked AcuraWatch and lacked AndroidAuto, both essential features imho.\n\nOn the TLX 2.4 the 0-60 acceleration, to be blunt, seems about the same as an Accord to me\xe2\x80\x94although how you get there is different. At first acceleration seems faster in the TLX in 1st and 2nd, but then as it quickly goes toward 4th, 5th and beyond, it just loses punch. This is all in ""Normal"" mode. I think I might try Sport for a while and see what that\'s like. The TLX\'s 2.4 engine, of course, is a slightly souped up version of the Accord\'s engine that\'s made to take advantage of premium gas.\n\nBut aside from the engine almost everything else is a big upgrade over an Accord. For the most part, you can\'t even tell that there\'s any relation between the two cars. The steering with PAWS is sharper and better, the transmission with the 8-speed dual clutch is also a very different experience from a CVT, the leather seats feel as comfortable and supportive as those of the new BMW I was just in yesterday, the suspension has that planted feeling almost like you are riding on rails (but it\'s still really comfortable), etc. And the the sound system is beyond anything Honda offers, and maybe even better than what\'s offered in a comparable BMW or Lexus.'","b""Just curious, do you remember if the A5 was FWD or quattro?

Beautiful, I loved it. But in terms of performance and fuel economy, it was a slightly improved product of 1990s. My only concern with my current four turbo is its long term durability. Its first iteration was introduced in 2012 models, so the jury is still out on true long-term numbers. Mid-term seems OK, as there are no massive failures at 100k+ threshold being reported so far. We had a very long track record with the N/A straight six. Those four cylinders are still building the record. One positive, it seems the owners, dealers and garages got the memo regarding proper oil grades this time, unlike in 80s, when turbos were used first time the stakeholders had no idea how to properly maintain those engines. Cheap mineral oil was the king back then, it would sometimes kill the scroller bearings in 60k miles from coking, even if changed at 3k miles, as the oil particles were just too large for fast scrollers.'",b''

Of course, my car cheats by only having 2 doors and being a coupe, so it's not a sedan, nor entry level.""","b'Current 3-series sedan is 182"". 5-series is 194. Kia is 190.

b'January 21',b'dino001',"b""flightnurse said:\nDino do tell about your 430 GC!!\n\nWhen it comes to Hyundai/Kia I think we need to be watching them. The first Gen Stinger is a looker and performs well, but isn't perfect. Give the mid life cycle and next Gen I think the Germans will have problems. For the price of my 330i, I could have bought the top of line Stinger GT and have money leftover and the V6 Stinger is quicker than a 340/440i.\n\nOn the other hand, I have fallen in love with the Volvo V90, the design is stunning, and the price is perfect and you don't see many Wagons on the road.\nThe car is great so far. I picked it up in Munich in June, drove south to Switzerland, then southern France (Provance), swept along Cote d\xe2\x80\x99Azur to Milan and back to Munich. Then picked it up in Spartanburg in late Septempebr and drove home to Tampa. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s almost 9 thosand miles and perfect. Have to admit, although I miss the sound of my previous straight six, the four cylinder turbo is both quicker less thirsty by 20 percent. Even the automatic doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bother me, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably one of the best in the market. The electric steering, which used to be a major issue with early F3x generation, is finally fixed. It\xe2\x80\x99s precise, albeit lighter than my previous 328. No longer Buick like. I think they tweaked standard 4-series, including GC to be slightly more sporty than standard 3. The standard suspension is also quite alright. I got luxury package without adaptive suspension and don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like missing anything.\n\nIn other words, the car is just fine with my growing up and getting stiffer in the joints, but maintains most important aspects of the handling. And there is that rear hatch""","b'show previous quotes\nSo the Stinger looks like a legitimate effort from Kia. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope people will buy it, so it stays in the market. If it is 5-series size, then $50k+ sticker for fully loaded fast supercharged V6 may be ok, considering Kia always throws in decent cash incentives. Low end 2 liter starts 35k, so that\xe2\x80\x99s much more pallatable and separated in price from lux and comparable to four cyl turbos from other brands, too. One knock against is the mpg on GT, when you compare it with, say BMW\xe2\x80\x99s 3.0 six turbo. It souns a bit like the previous gen without much fuel asavinlg tech. It may be a positive for some.'"

After hiking investment in plants, equipment and new technology from a peak this year, Daimler plans to rein back spending in the years ahead, CEO Zetsche said this week.\n\nBMW\'s global deliveries rose 9.4 percent to 197,419 cars in September, boosting the nine-month total by 6 percent to 1.48 million vehicles, the company said in a statement.\n\nBy comparison, Mercedes\'s sales jumped 12.1 percent to 211,286 vehicles in September, lifting the total by 11.7 percent to 1.54 million, according to a separate statement.

However, with MSD, you are basically buying down the money factor (APR) of the lease, which means lowerimg your monthly payment.

Here, the lesee exchanges cash for lower cost of borrowing (money factor, by extension lower payment). In some way, it\'s similar to points on mortgage, but temporary, not permanent.\n\nThe lessor\'s benefit is cash today, which they can dispose as they see fit.

In small and midsize towns, local Chevy or Buick dealer also got a Caddy franchise, so they could sell them to small local business people and their families - model that worked in 70s, when German competition was small and super-exquisite (Benz only sold what today would have been loaded E-class or up, at price point equivalent to today\'s S-Class) and Japanese brands were literally non-existent.\n\nIn today\'s world with all-out competition in premium at all levels, it simply doesn\'t cut it - the accessibility is a good thing, but in today\'s reality it collides too much with exclusivity they wish to project. They\'d do better if they pulled sales franchises from those weak dealers, but supplied them with authorized service licenses.\n\nEssentially, you buy your Caddy in a big showroom, comparable to those of MB, BMW, or Lexus, in a nearby big city, but can service it at a local Buick dealer garage, provided it passes the necessary requirements. That model might actually work. In Europe they generally have denser authorized service network than sales.

Like you, I think it has good styling, but probably for some it still seems to be a bit bland.\n\nThe base engine is a very nice 2.4 liter direct-injected model that's a more advanced version of what you get on the Accord. But most competitors have turbo base models that are faster.\n\nThe 8-speed in-house dual-clutch transmission on the TLX with the 2.4 has gotten mostly good reviews, but the 9-speed that goes with the V-6 has gotten mixed to negative reviews.\n\nAcura doesn't seem to get much credit for its high quality, durability, and reliability. And the exotic 4-wheel steering that's standard on the car doesn't seem to help it stand out, but no doubt cost a pretty penny to engineer and put into the car.\n\nFinally, the Accord now has AndroidAuto/AppleCarPlay, but the TLX isn't scheduled to get that until the early introduction of the restyled and enhanced TLX that's coming next year as a 2018 model.""","b""Yeah, but doesn't MSD sort of contradict why you lease in the first place?"""

b'May 2016',b'dino001',"b'Cadillac is a tragic case of a complete mismatch between aspirations and reality on many different levels. It all starts with pricing not matching the current perception (whether the perception is correct or not, doesn\'t really matter at this time), production capacity and sales network. They want to be ""prestigous"", but their production capacity and especially dealer network is a legacy of their heyday well before German and Japanese brands took over that market.\n\nI read that Detroit\'s problem has always been (across the board for all brands) inability to scale down production to match current demand, which in turn made them incentive addicts. They essentially make a car and then try to sell it. Others often have mindset that they won\'t make a car until they have some evidence it\'s actually needed somewhere. It can be a real order (customer\'s or dealer\'s - BMW operates that way), deep market studies, or simple case of matching cars that sold (Japanese reportedly do it that way). In other words - they want to (at least virtually) sell the car before making it. Detroit makes it first (because you know, union contracts, sales targets, etc.) and then find a customer for it. Any attempt of changing that mindset, while positive in general long term, requires willingness of taking short or even longer lasting intermediate pain of sales drops, production shutdowns and contract breaks with minor dealers.\n\nFor comparison, Tampa Bay (not including Sarasota) has 3 BMW, MB, 2 Audi and 2 Acura, 1 Jaguar store, and only 4 Cadillac stores, which doesn\'t sound bad. But extend the radius to just 50 miles and the picture changes dramatically: it adds about one dealer for Sarasota for all Germans, one store in Lakeland for BMW and MB, but Cadillac\'s network grows to 13 stores. Considering sales numbers and it is clearly nuts. May be convenient, but there is no pricing power. I\'m sure those dealers are hurting, too. This of course quickly rolls downhill into contentious relationships with customers, as dealer that doesn\'t have any money will not support their customer.\n\nCadillac\'s management keeps wanting to have the cake and eat it. They want large sales, no incentives and high prestige - we all know that ain\'t gonna happen. You can pick two. They probably know it, too - but their stakeholders are too entrenched and simply unwilling to take the necessary real steps to fix it - they rather pretend doing something and then act surprised that things are not going as planned.'","b'Luxury sales in April:\n\n1.

I didn\'t notice hardly any change in a Lexus IS350 for example, and it had 4 different settings! The S3 only has 2 truly different settings; definitely noticeable.

You think car maker determines this.\nI think there are certainly many examples of products that are -- for whatever reasons -- equal to or even better than other products but the two products are in different classes. Let me give a non-auto example: Tissot makes/markets watches. These time pieces are often feature laden, attractive and cost a fraction of other Swiss made time pieces. Breitling makes/market watches. These time pieces are often feature laden, attractive and cost many multiples of ""similar"" Tissot time pieces.\n\nIt is possible to pick up a ""higher end"" Tissot with about every modern watch feature and function (complications) known to humans -- and the thing will cost hundreds of dollars (and is often discounted on top of that).\n\nIt is virtually impossible to pick up a ""lower end"" Breitling that has only a date a sweep second hand function for under $2,000. Far as I know they both will tell time equally well and both will last for decades, lifetimes even.\n\nTissots, even ones studded with diamonds, are not considered high-end watches. A watch super-store such as Tourneau sells Rolex, Movado, Tag and also sells Bulova, Seiko and Tissot -- if a Tourneau outlet is near you, check out the brands, perhaps you\'ll see what I\'m referring to. The Rolex is to BMW as Seiko or Tissot is to the Genesis. The market perceives what it perceives. And in the instance of BMW vs Genesis like Rolex and Seiko, ""Perception is Reality.""\n\nDimensions, decibels at 70MPH, number of speakers in the sound system, suppleness of ride or even country of origin doesn\'t change -- or hasn\'t thus far changed -- the reality that the Genesis is not currently considered an LPS vehicle; indeed, it is also not, yet, considered an ELLPS vehicle.\n\nIt, the Genesis, is a ""cheap car that\'s really nice""[sic].\n\nSimilarly, the Toyota Avalon isn\'t a Lexus -- probably for the same perception reason. My feelings of consternation regarding the A3 vs the rest of the Audi lineup (or, similarly, the entry level Mercedes vs the other Merc\'s) still stands. Likewise: My belief that Tissot makes timepieces that equal Breitling\'s products, insofar as their ability to keep time, also stands -- but I don\'t for a minute think that Tissot or Seiko, etc, are high-end Premium watches.\n\nGenesis\' cars, no matter how feature laden, no matter how statistically similar, etc, are not in the same class as BMW\'s. The market\'s perception, not mine, not yours -- currently indicating BMW is LPS and Genesis is not -- is reality.\n\nMaybe there will be a reversal of fortune for both of these successful companies -- thus far, there is scant evidence of that.

They also did my cabin air filter, the motor oil, and I asked for a front brake service including new fluid as my pads were starting to scratch metal on metal on 1/2"" ring just a week before my scheduled service (took two weeks to get into this shop from when I called; they are too good and popular and busy as a result!). Rotors when correctly priced even the large fronts were only $125 each, but still a hard pill to swallow twice now for me (due to track-use). This time, (unlike the first which was totally my fault for ignoring the sensor lights), I didn\'t get all the dummy light sensors warning me my pads were low; might need to ask Audi why the brake pad sensors didn\'t warn me and to pony up for the rotors as a result Also need to ask my shop again what the diagnosis/theory is for the failure of the sensors to warn me I was scoring my rotors with metal on metal contact. Perhaps the pads were unevenly worn from overheating during 100+ degree track days; causing the lack of warning. Need to follow up with them. My front pads are not really meant to be track abused more than probably 1 weekend (they were put through 2 as well as 19,000 miles).\n\nCR came out with 2014/15 results of the most reliable Car brands, and Audi as real-world observance between you and I seems to agree with, is at the top of the chart along with a couple others for good reason.

Somehow, the $4,995 MontBlanc, although expensive, doesn't seem as expensive as a $1,795 Tissot or $2,995 Movado. The Tags, too, can soar in price, but they don't actually seem out of line, even at $6,995 or higher.\n\nCadillac, today, may be Movado, in some cases, however, it may be perceived as a high-end Tissot. For me, that means, if I'm going to pay THAT much for a Cadillac, I might as well get an Audi, BMW or Mercedes -- and if I am on a budget and want a bunch of stuff (high content), well a Genesis starts looking as good as the Cadillac and priced appropriately. Genesis is Tissot, but can make you believe you got the Movado.\n\nCadillac today can't quite pull of making you believe you got the BMW -- other than the price you are asked to pay.\n\nI'm just not in the market for a $4,995 Tissot.\n\nThe malls may be a great place to shop efficiently, but when Cadillac is in the lineup, it just seems -- at this juncture -- overpriced.""",b''

In other words, BMW uses exactly the same invoice-to-retail scheme, just at lower levels. I think the difference comes from BMW using dealer same way to purchase the vehicle, whereas others may be using their dealers only to handle the paperwork (and purchase is direct from them).\n2. BMW 7% (now going to 5%) discount on both invoice and retail price applies ONLY to the base price of each line (e.g. 328i, 335i, 535ix, etc.). All options (such as metallic paint, premium pack, nav, etc.) are priced at same level as US delivery. Destination charge (BMW loves advertising ""from"" without inclusion of those $900+, like we actually had an option of not paying it - I really hate that, it\'s unseemly) is also full US level, no discount. This makes the ""blended"" discount closer to 5.8-6.5% for more heavily optioned vehicles - now it will be just about 4-4.5%.\n3.

You negotiate with the dealer where you hit within that spread. Values strongly depend on markets - some dealers don\'t even want to hear about discounting from ED MSRP (following theory of always preferring selling a unit from the lot rather than one not built yet). Unlike US deliveries, ED vehicles are not subject to allotments, training fee, or some other fees BMW may charge the dealers.

Well, Honda got caught a few years back -- same thing.\n\nThe list of ""who\'s done it"" seems to be much bigger than the current scandal.\n\nThis doesn\'t forgive any company -- and it is more serious than Hyundai fudging the MGPs of their cars or Acura claiming their cars had more HP than could be tested, and so on -- but the thing is, I have read (in car magazines) interviews, over the years, from top car company executives who have claimed the MPG and emissions requirements go ""to the practical limit"" of technology then go beyond what is known to be capable for any realistic sum of money.\n\nNothing said here is meant to forgive the lie.\n\nHowever, isn\'t it possible -- in the current climate -- to find some ""objective"" engineers and/or scientists who could say ""here is what we are able to do TODAY at this price; here is what we\'re able to do TODAY at that price,"" and so forth. I understand if a Martin Winterkorn goes before ""the government"" and says ""this is what is possible at a cost of $xxx per car; and what you want us to do would cost ($xxxx) per car"" the government doubts the veracity of the remarks.\n\nSo, the government wants a car to emit this much pollution and go this far on a gallon of fuel (or whatever is used to power the vehicle); apparently it can\'t be done at a market acceptable price today. Then you factor in that CAFE often gives a pass to trucks, so the mfgr goes ahead and creates a 2-cylinder car with a cardboard back seat, no sound insulation and made with the lightest weight materials -- that are inexpensive -- known to the designers.\n\nI guess it is possible to increase the EPA ratings in all of the good ways by making cars out of carbon fiber and unobtanium, and powering them with a fuel cell and a solar sail -- but, said cars will cost 300% of the traditionally built autos. So, you\'re $25,000 car will satisfy the EPA, etc, but, it will cost $75,000.\n\nThis, if at least in spirit is correct, is unworkable and for most folks unaffordable.\n\nAgain, this does not forgive lying, but I can only assume that the corporate thought process, since it keeps happening over and over, arrives at the conclusion that the cost of getting caught is less than the cost of [attempting] compliance.

b'September 2015',b'flightnurse',"b'So we left Beaune Wed morning about 9am, destination, Charles de Gaulle (GDC) airport, most of BMW drop off locations are at airports, we were scheduled to fly out of CDG, but the day before I found a much better flight out of London (Rick has a couple of ex-co workers now living in London) cancelled the original flights now book our new flights out of London Heathrow, all flights were booked on Frequent Flyer Miles, and one nice thing is when you cancel there is no charge, most airlines these days will charge you a ""close in"" fee if you book an award travel with in 2 weeks, however, since I have elite status with AA, that is waved for me.\n\nWe super slabbed it to CDG, nice thing about France is speed limit is 130Kph, which is about 80, But like any country people travel faster then that. I averaged 90mph. We arrived at CDG at 130pm, got he car washed, (US customs requires the car to be ""clean."" there is a carwash at CDG, 8 euro later car was clean. Now, if you have been to Paris you know he city is horrible to drive in, and the French are just crazy drivers (really look at their cars), however, the route I programmed took us to the outside of Paris and missed most of the traffic. About 30 minutes before getting to the airport, the windshield cracks, I did not hear a rock or something hit it. Luckily the insurance on the car (that BMW pays for) will replace it. We get to the drop off location of the car, sign the necessary paperwork, and we are done, we say good by to the car, wont see her for at least 2 weeks. Total 3127 K driven on this vacation.\n\n\n\n\nYes, there is a crack if you look in the middle of the photo\n\n\n\n\nFarewell photo...\n\n\n\nThe Euro plates will stay on the car when it arrives at the Dealer, and the Dealer been instructed to leave the front plate on (AZ does not require a front plate.)\n\nThis trip was about bucket list items, so another one was to take the Eurostar to London, the company that we dropped the car off took us to Gare du Nord train startion which is in the heart of Paris, it was an interesting drive.. We made it in 40 minutes, lets just say the French just do not care who they piss off. We bought the tickets at the train station, and was on board minutes later, we got the last two seats together facing forward. When we got on the train, there was this french women sitting in one of our seats, the business class trains are set up with single seats on one side, and two seats on the other, the two seats are set up to seat facing each other, so two people facing the direction of travel and the other are not. We we arrived, in her very broken English she wanted us to take the other seats, we said no. We knew from the seat map when we bought the tickets 3 people were sitting here, not 4. Come to find out, she decided she didn\'t like her single seat, plus a friend of her was on the train and wanted our seats. so they can sit together. Now the other passenger arrives (older lady), then the cabin attendant. The single rider (older lady) sits where the young women was to have sat, but she was refusing to move, and wanted us to sit in the other seats. Rick doesn\'t like traveling backwards. We tell the cabin attended this and we wanted our original seats, the young women speak french (but I think she speaks English too) to the cabin attended, so we end up in this circle of language, I think look at the young women, and said, I knew you speak English, so stop playing games. I was right, she did, so she understood everything I was saying, which really pissed me off. So I told her that we wanted our seats we reserved, if she didn\'t like then go find another compartment to ride in. She refused to move, needless to day, she won to a point, we were just moved to the Business Select Premium cabin... Like I said before of the French, We can do this because we are French.. It\'s the attitude that really piss\'s me off.. Europstar trains and dirty, they are getting new trains, I hope they have WIFI...\n\nWe arrived in London about 7pm, Ricks friends picked us up and took us out to dinner, then to our hotel.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe whole trip we talked about how this car will invoke memories as long as we have it. This is really the only way to buy a car, BMW will allow you to keep your trade in until your car arrives, I\'m sure Audi and MB will do the same thing.

The DSG is the smoothest transmission I\'ve ever driven in that, when left in auto shift mode, the shifts are basically heard, not felt. I know the transmission has up-shifted by ear and by virtue of the drop of the tach needle, but the progression in feeling is unlike traditional torque converter auto transmissions and unlike manual transmissions. Both the Tip and the manual transmissions have a momentary disruption of forward momentum when the transmission decides to shift or when the driver depresses the clutch -- watching from the side, when either one of these transmissions is up-shifted, the heads of the driver and a front-seat passenger are momentarily ""thrown"" forward at the moment of the depression of the clutch or up-shift of the auto -- there is no such throwing or lurching with the DSG -- in fact in that ONE aspect, I would think the DSG could be said to be somewhat like a CVT.

Now, I haven\'t been the biggest fan of it in some of our other cars (TT, A3), but I thought the particular application in the S4 was outstanding.\n\nAt the end of the day, I made my decision based on ""one last go"" with the manual. I appreciate that Audi still offers it on the outgoing model, and thought I\'d take advantage of it. That was a significant reason why I don\'t have too much heartache over buying a model that I knew would be replaced in the short-term.\n\nI suspect the manual won\'t be offered on the new model. When the S3 isn\'t offered with it, and they just took it away from the R8, I can\'t imagine why Audi would choose to offer it on the S4.\n\nIn any case, if I were to upgrade to the new model in the future, I don\'t think the 8-speed tip would deter me. I\'ve had similar transmissions in previous cars (535, X3) and thought they were great.'"
b'September 2015',b'andres3',"b'markcincinnati said:\nshow previous quotes\nWith all due respect and a showing of [my own] ignorance, I wonder what driveability issues are you referring to?\n\nGiven that both hardware and software components are in a state of constant revision, I can share some observations from the perspective of one who has a 2014 SQ5 (8-speed Tip) and a 2014 S4 (7-speed DSG) in captivity.\n\nThe programming of the Tip makes it the best iteration of the ""slush"" transmission -- as someone called it -- I\'ve ever driven. The DSG is the smoothest transmission I\'ve ever driven in that, when left in auto shift mode, the shifts are basically heard, not felt. I know the transmission has up-shifted by ear and by virtue of the drop of the tach needle, but the progression in feeling is unlike traditional torque converter auto transmissions and unlike manual transmissions. Both the Tip and the manual transmissions have a momentary disruption of forward momentum when the transmission decides to shift or when the driver depresses the clutch -- watching from the side, when either one of these transmissions is up-shifted, the heads of the driver and a front-seat passenger are momentarily ""thrown"" forward at the moment of the depression of the clutch or up-shift of the auto -- there is no such throwing or lurching with the DSG -- in fact in that ONE aspect, I would think the DSG could be said to be somewhat like a CVT. Somewhat, not much, but a little ""somewhat.""\n\nDownshifting, again, is an area where the DSG excels -- when in full auto-mode ""S""port shifting program, the DSG transmission rev matches to the imminent downshift and the ""second"" clutch engages with virtually no kick. Only a manual transmission even comes close to this, but having said that, the DSG is so much smoother on a rev-matching down shift it isn\'t even close.\n\nNow, I\'ve driven the S4 (DSG), SQ5 (Tip) and S6 (DSG) equipped cars -- of the three, two of them are just that little bit better in terms of their shifting prowess and smoothness. Again, with all of the above subtleties stated for the record, it is apparent that someone at Audi (or whoever writes the software) has done everything they can to make virtually all of the ""dead giveaways"" that you are driving a Tip as invisible and imperceptible as possible. In short, unless you\'re really looking for HARD EVIDENCE that the SQ5 isn\'t a DSG, you might not really notice the SQ5 is not a DSG. Over time and with the availability (as I have) of two very very similar cars to drive back-to-back for comparison, well, you probably would be able to discern the subtle differences between the DSG and the Tip.\n\nAt this stage of my own posterior meter, I can tell the difference between the DSG and the Tip -- the Tip, NOT the DSG has some hint of drivability issues and even placing the Tip in ""S"" all of the time doesn\'t completely wipe out the ever-so-slight shift hesitation and shift lurch behaviors, although you really have to be paying attention to notice them.\n\nI have not (yet) driven an RS7 -- frankly because I just don\'t think it is worth $120,000 (even if I had millions in the check book to do with as I please). I also don\'t think an S7 is worth $10,000 more than an S6 just for the body style. But I\'m also the guy who resents an extra charge for ""paint"" beyond gloss black or gloss white.\n\nI bring the RS7 up, not to reveal my proclivities and, er, cheapness for things such as pearl paint colors, but to remind anyone who needs to know, that Audi puts the very specially programmed 8-speed Tip in the RS7. Several reviews of the car noted their assumption that the RS7 transmission was another very fine implementation of the DSG; and, then, noting later in their review how virtually imperceptible the Tip is from the DSG as executed in the RS7.\n\nUnder full throttle in dynamic mode, both our S4 and SQ5 are prodigious accelerative forces of nature -- both of them emit the joyful ""PHLTTTBBB"" (aka fart sound) upon up-shift and when in S mode have quick paddle shift moves (but paddle-shifts are just a smidge quicker in the DSG, however).\n\nAgain, were the Audi folk to gift me (fat chance) a 2017 MY S4 Prestige 8-speed Tip with a torque vectoring rear differential and with red leather seats, I would be a happy man. Of course, this is based on my assumption that the hardware and especially the shifting software of the 2017 S4 Tip had continued to move it even closer to the characteristics of a DSG (which appears to be the programmers goal).\n\nI have heard that the BMW implementation of the dual-clutch auto did indeed have driveability issues -- but I have only heard that the Audi and Porsche implementation and programming of the DSG have few, if any, critics.\n\nWhat are the Audi DSG transmission issues?\n\nAnd, why, if the DSG is not a fun, friendly transmission for daily driving, do they (the mfgrs) keep making the programming of the Tip versions as close to the feeling of a DSG as possible?\nI\'d agree that Audi\'s implementation of DSG is spectacular both in 6-speed form in my \'06 A3 (they mastered this 9 years ago at least), and in the 7-speed iteration of my S4. In D mode the S4 is smoother and more ""auto"" like than in the A3. To me, the tiny bit of lurching when coming to a stop is normal, I\'m used to it, expect it, and don\'t notice it at all as such. I have heard that Audi did get some complaints with the early DSG\'s for not being very ""auto-smooth"" like. People didn\'t seem to understand it behaves more mechanical, more connected, and that it is a good thing as it is more like a manual in that sense. I don\'t mind feeling the shift under power.\n\nI\'m afraid this change has nothing to do with drive-ability or consumer feedback, but simply a bean counter telling Audi they can make xxx $$$ more per car by using a cheap transmission rather than the best but pricey DSG. This bean counter is in for a rude awakening when sales plummet. The new R8 gets Audi\'s best dual clutch transmission, so they have figured out how to make it work in very high HP and torque heavy monsters.\n\nI think the review above comparing the very good 8-speed auto to DSG will echo a lot of other people\'s reviews of the ZF-8 speed tiptronic. It is good, but not quite as good as DSG. Progress going the wrong direction. Perhaps the mid-cycle refresh will correct the mistake, or it is Audi\'s way of raising the carrot to make people purchase the RS4 to get the right transmission.'","b""@breld - When the car would reach your dealership in CO for re-delivery, you'd trade it in!"""

Very enjoyable and enlightening.\nHere is the thing - those bailouts create resentments, especially when you consider that France used to be a superpower, cultural and science center of the world. Until WW2 French was the language of cultural elites and scientists (most articles with scientific breakthroughs were published in French journals). All of it went away in just few years, after a humiliating defeat (France didn\'t put much longer resistance than half sized Poland, attacked from behind by Sovients). Reminding them about it is not helpful, it\'s kind of like this big kid from high school with good heart but no manners pulled you out of the school yard butt kicking and then every time he sees you, or visits your house, he loudly proclaims to everybody who can hear how much he sacrificed and how grateful you should be to him.

I\'m from the part if the world that had misfortune to be ""liberated\' by the Red Army and I would trade with French in a second. However, you also need to understand the wounded pride, which resulted in irrational lashing out against the very people who don\'t deserve it, but are close and convenient. The best way to deal with it is shrug it off and not get too flustered. It\'s just ignorance. Also, you need to remember that while substantial sacrifice was made, USA was also by far the greatest beneficiary of the new world order after the War and the casualties suffered are not even in the same order of magnitude and devastation than those suffered by the Europeans. Average European sees America as a net beneficiary of the War and it\'s not an unfair view from the global perspective (grant you not necessarily you father\'s).\n\nAmerican soldier came, fought gallantly, often died or got wounded, but then came back to his country that was intact and stronger than ever.

b'September 2015',b'markcincinnati',"b'I agree with the sentiments regarding civility, manners, rudeness, surliness, etc. I did take history in elementary, high-school and at Miami University. As a visitor in many European and Central European (I\'ve not gone east of the Czech Republic or Poland) I have not ever felt I should be entitled to anything due to America\'s participation and help in past wars. I have Brussel-ian, Italian, Netherlandian and Luxemborgian (?) relatives. My relatives all speak at least three languages, the folks who live in The Haugue speak, Dutch, German, French, Italian and English.\n\nThe locals in Prague, universally seem to speak, in this order, Russian, German, English and Czech (some also add another language, either French, Polish or Italian). So many folks, however, seem to have a first goto language.\n\nMy point in some previous posts was the contrast between citizens of various countries -- the French were rude (at least some were); initially, I would not automatically assume they would know if we were British or Americans -- all the menus use the British flag to indicate which part of the menu is in English. I don\'t recall ever seeing the American flag in any country on a menu to indicate English translation here. I rarely told anyone where I was from, unless asked -- which the folks at Oktoberfest in Munich seem keen to know.\n\nI don\'t think anyone I\'ve ever known who has been to Europe goes there with anything less than a sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the countrysides, the diversity of the cities (knowing that they are not 200 years old, but multiple times 200 years old). I know of no one travelling to a European destination, who has anything but a desire for a vacation -- it has never occurred to me to think too much about WWII, while visiting a European country, for instance, other than my trips to Poland (Krakow, Warsaw) where we went to the concentration camps, the salt mines. Then there was the trip to see old Warsaw which was lovingly restored after it was virtually leveled during the war. Even Prague which does have some remnants of Soviet occupation, seems much more of the now, not the then, so to speak.\n\nI have been to Germany and Italy the most, and I have been to German museums which do put history on display -- the good, the bad and the pure evil that we all have learned about. In Amsterdam, I went to Ann Frank\'s house, which was also presented, er, ""objectively."" Been to Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin, too -- went to the museum, which again put some very unpleasant things on display. But the trip to the Doges Palace in Venice with the torture devices on display, is also quite eye opening.\n\nI don\'t recall any resentment of the US on display anywhere -- the museums didn\'t editorialize or express regret, anger or, hmm, je ne sais quoi. I saw nothing that would encourage an American to somehow believe in their superiority. There were, generally speaking, no ugly Americans -- or even ignorant ones as were depicted in the Hepburn movie, set in Venice, ""Summertime.""\n\nContinuing . . .\n\nTook a tour of the Maginot Line, and my tour guide -- French -- made fun of France for ""how you say, a lame attempt to prevent the Germans from invading."" We did smile at his attempt at humor, but again, most of my two dozen+ trips to Europe have been as a guest in the [whatever] country, and I was pleased to be able to be a guest, in fact, I often was humbled by the locals as they were multi-lingual, whereas I was only able to speak a little German (I took lessons for about three months back in the 20th Century). I expected very little out of the local folks I would interact with, other than a certain level of courtesy since they were, after all in the hospitality business; and I did not condescend to them.\n\nYet, go figure, the French sometimes seemed on the verge of being annoyed by our presence with the exception of those involved with customer service at very high buck restaurants and our hotel, the PARIS - LE GRAND ($500+ per night, 5 stars). BTW, the hotel is an oh wow experience. I loved it, but I would, knowing what I now know, never stay there again (since most of the time we were there, in our room, it was night and we were in the room with no lights on, sleeping; I can find a very nice place to sleep for less than half that amount (often 3 stars), in other words; if my goal was to just stay at the hotel, I might think differently, however.)\n\nAnyway, FN has really come through for us all -- lots of great travel and adventure, great pics and of course some car talk. I, for one, would love to hear more about the car, the driving -- any positives, any surprises, overall impressions, any ""I wish it did this"" comments, etc. It is a BMW, after all, so I would expect it to do almost everything in fine fashion, but still. Hey FN, what features and options did you configure the thing with, and which ones are you most impressed by? Is this your first vehicle with Sat Nav, if not, how is BMW\'s interface in your opinion?\n\nBack to some travel tips. . .\n\nFar as I\'m concerned, Paris should be on everyone\'s list -- at least once.

We are staying in a place called L\'Alberete it\'s a hotel right in the middle of wine country, the views are breathtaking.\n\nSo to catch you up on the driving from yesterday, we left Salzburg to go to Lake Hallstatt, what a place, and the tourist love it. It\'s also home to one of the biggest salt mines in Austria. The Drive there was about 2 hours, nothing to really report, ate lunch hung around and left, about 2pm. Now this is where it gets weird, we I put the info into the Nav system to get us to Ljubljana, Solvenia I told it NOT to take toll road or highway. This was a big mistake. The Nav system said it was about 200 KM away, and said we would arrive about 6pm, About two hours into the drive I noticed the time to arrive keep getting longer, I went back into the nav system and saw what was chosen as the route all ""B"" roads.. I fixed this but we were so far buried into the ALPS it didn\'t matter, we saw some great places, then we came upon a accident. After sitting for about 30 minutes, one of the fireman came up and told us we can wait 2-3 hours before it is cleared or we can turn around and take the ""detour"", when I asked him about this detour he couldn\'t answer the question, mind you the Nav gave us an alternate routes but we had to go forward about 20km before they took effect (that wasn\'t going to work.) so we turned around and followed people who were just as lost, but they spoke German. We got a gas station and asked someone there, they gave us direction and found the detour,once we got half way through the detour we turn the Nav back on and found us a route to get moving. But this route, routed us OVER the ALPS, we hit the highest point of 1765 meters (close to 6K ft) we finally got into Slovenia, and arrived at are hotel about 815pm, about 2 hours later then we wanted.. Ljubljana is a wonderful city, we hit the town about 845 for dinner, we were supised on how many people were walking about, we were by the river that splints the city in town. Lots of history there and we both want to go back. It\'s a very modern city.\n\nSalzburg has large elect bus network, but you have to see this mess all over the place.\n\n\n\nAustria, like German have a lot of lakes, this is just one of them. Here we meet a daughter and father who were riding bikes from Munich to Lake Halstatt they are on holiday..\n\n\n\nHatchback and Wagons are all over the place in Germany and Austria, this has to be one of the more popular models around Europe, I would day 90% of them are diesels I saw many 118d or 120d\'s. BMW also makes this as a 3 door hatch, also the A3 5 door (the one we get) as well as the A1 is very popular, and most are oil burners.\n\n\n\nFirst real photos of the car in bright sunlight the blue look amazing..\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 3 series has a mid-life cycle for 2016, but the GT and 4 series do not get one, however, both the GT and 4 series have received some updates that the 3 series gets. First the Rims, these have more of a grey tone to them less silver, also the middle consul and AC controls are different and lastly, the rear exhaust is black not silver this photo shows the rear exhaust.\n\n\n\nThe next two are in Lake Hallstatt, truly an amazing place.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast is a shot of a town we detoured through, got to love iPhones and GPS, I had no idea the name of this town, but when you take a photo with the phone it says the GPS coordinates and will stamp the photo with the name later on. The name of this town is Bad Aussee, it was really charming. BTW I don\'t think this town gets this many cars...'",b'Wow!'

b'August 2015',b'markcincinnati',"b'In the mid-1980\'s, I owned an Audi (what else?) 5000CS turbo quattro, then Audi\'s top-of-the-line car. Manual transmission, power everything and a new to the market feature (and quite a rare feature on almost any car outside of an Audi, BMW or Mercedes) anti-lock brakes. For some reason I ordered the car with the optional wool covered sports seats, eschewing the standard leather treatments. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not important to my warning and plea to anyone reading this.\n\nThis mid-80\xe2\x80\x99s Audi had a permanently mounted voice controlled and activated cellular telephone. While driving, if I uttered the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cTurn on telephone\xe2\x80\x9d I could \xe2\x80\x9cCall home,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cCall office,\xe2\x80\x9d or recite a phone number \xe2\x80\x93 one number at a time, wait for the phone to repeat the number, and so on until the full number had been spoken, then dial. Hands free, eyes free. It was 1985.\n\nMy first Audi S6, a 1996 model was the next Audi I purchased that came with a factory phone (it was hidden in the arm-rest) permitting voice command. This version was updated and allowed me to recite the phone number in single digits without waiting for the phone to parrot my number back to me.\n\nWhen I then purchased a new 1997 A8, I was somewhat amazed that it came pre-wired for a phone, but without a phone. Of course I ponied up for another voice activated phone. When I got my 2003 allroad it came with a special in-armrest holder for an Audi-branded phone and it also came with On*Star which was also a phone (voice activated) and an email client (that read my emails to me and also allowed me to send emails by speaking). My 2005 A6 was bluetooth equipped and came with a list of phones I could buy from several different providers and also had a special, in-armrest holder/charger that was invisible with the arm-rest cover closed.\n\nMy 2009 A4, 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD and my 2014 S4 also are equipped with bluetooth and they also have pig-tails for charging and [iPhone] music connectivity. Every one of these cars I mention, since 1985, has had hand and eyes free phone capability and ever improving voice command capabilities.\n\nI finally have gotten around to keeping my iPhone in my breast pocket, but for years my iPhone often was in the trunk where I put my brief case. The phone works fine when it is in the trunk \xe2\x80\x93 and now, since I do use the phone for email and texting (after pulling over), I tend to keep the phone in the cabin.\n\nEvery few seconds or minutes someone has a crash or is killed and the \xe2\x80\x9cincident\xe2\x80\x9d (they are not accidents) causing the property damage or living being damage is attributed to texting or other mobile device distracted driving.\n\nThe technology exists to disallow talking and texting in a moving vehicle. I assume no challenge would exist to make the phone work if it is being used via bluetooth hand and eyes free initiation. The clock is ticking backwards, to zero, to a time when we will have no ability to use these communication\xe2\x80\x99s devices in a moving car.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s what confuses me: Since there had been some kind of hand and eyes free, voice-activated communications available since the mid-1980\xe2\x80\x99s, how is it possible that I cannot drive more than one mile out of my rural subdivision without seeing someone driving their ELLPS (and I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it to ELLPS cars, even though such technology is hardly limited to the Premium class and above) with their phone held up to their ear (requiring one hand)? As I get closer to the Interstate and traffic density increases, I could probably throw a handful of rice into oncoming traffic and hit more cars than not whose drivers are holding their phones \xe2\x80\x93 and I am certain many of the rice grains would hit bluetooth equipped vehicles.\n\nBefore you respond, here\xe2\x80\x99s another data point, most of the cars have one person in them \xe2\x80\x93 the driver.\n\nI get my car serviced, I am provided with a loaner \xe2\x80\x93 before I pull out of the dealership, I pair my phone with the loaner\xe2\x80\x99s Bluetooth \xe2\x80\x93 if I\xe2\x80\x99m distracted, this takes 30 seconds. My wife actually has the service manager pair her phone with the loaner, figuring it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the Audi Advantage (and the service writer always takes the 30 seconds to do this for her without issue).\n\nI thought, way back there 30 years ago, \xe2\x80\x9cI can completely be focussed on driving this stick-shift turbo-charged \xe2\x80\x98hot rod\xe2\x80\x99 quattro thanks to my hands and eyes free cellular phone.\xe2\x80\x9d Is this technology not \xe2\x80\x9cway cool\xe2\x80\x9d? And, is this technology not a HUGE safety feature, right up there with seat belts, crumple zones, ESP and ABS, sealed beam headlights, disc brakes and so on?\n\nI do want to be able to call home or the office without touching the phone, without looking at the phone and without pulling over and parking due to the inevitable governmental safety nanny. I want to delay yet another restriction brought on by my fellow drivers who opt for the most dangerous and deadly way I can think of to make a phone call.\n\nOf course, maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll be allowed to used a phone in the car once cars start driving themselves. Mean time, I\xe2\x80\x99d just like to advocate for voluntary cessation of in-car phone usage if it is not hand and eyes free.\n\n""Don\'t it always seem to go . . . that you don\'t know what you\'ve got \'til it\'s gone?""

b'August 2015',b'benjaminh',"b'Will the NSX, Acura\'s upcoming $150,000 halo car, help spur sales of more entry-level vehicles? That\'s the plan. Difficult to say if it\'ll pan out, but I think it will provide some pizzazz and buzz for Acura dealers. Prototypes are now being made, but the NSX won\'t be for sale for about 6 months as a 2017 model. Auto Blog as some tidbits they\'ve gotten from the engineers and builders of the NSX, which is being built in Ohio:\n\nhttp://www.autoblog.com/2015/08/15/acura-nsx-cosworth-engine-block-details/\n\n""Acura NSX will use Cosworth block, plus other neat tidbits\n\n\nThe blue NSX you see here was built just two weeks ago. Prototype number six, it rolled off Acura\'s newest assembly line in Ohio and was rushed out to the Monterey peninsula for various car week activities. We had a chance to sit down with several members of the NSX team to discuss the car, the long road from concept to production, and some interesting details. Below are some choice bits from our conversations.\n\nAcura is pretty proud of the fact that NSX version 2.0 was designed and is being built in the US. The new assembly line, called the Performance Manufacturing Center, is in Honda\'s hometown of Marysville, Ohio. While the line is brand new, the building has seen many uses over its lifetime, most recently as a warehouse facility. PMC staff numbers about 100, with 60 technical and 40 non-technical associates.\n\nThe car uses parts sourced globally, and one of those sources is Cosworth. The engine blocks and heads come from the English firm and get assembled into twin-turbo powerhouses at Honda\'s nearby Anna, Ohio, engine plant. The Cosworth name is rarely associated with a bad engine, so we were geeked to hear the NSX\'s 550-plus-horsepower hybrid powertrain has good genes....\n\n....the NSX buyer will get to make lots of decisions to craft a custom order. Choices will include paint, interior hues, several wheel styles and finishes, and additional carbon-fiber parts and trim; the standard car will have an aluminum roof, while a carbon piece can be spec\'d, and available carbon dress-up pieces will include side sills, a rear diffuser, and an engine dress-up kit.\nThe newly announced blue paint, called Nouvelle Blue Pearl, like the red used on the 2015 show car, uses a fancy multi-layer paint process from PPG that does a nice job of highlighting the surfacing and creases in the car\'s body. It gave the production engineers a headache, however, since it takes about 16 hours to cure versus regular paint\'s two-hour wait time. Not surprisingly, it will be an extra-cost option.""\n\nMore at the link.'","b'show previous quotes\n\n\nOwn one. The purchase price came in well below the MSRP you saw (at the time, in the neighborhood of low $40s). Personally, I think it\'s one of the best looking cars in the segment.

It\'s been a service and reliability nightmare. It\'s back in the service bay now, going on two weeks. That\'s on top of another two week stint in service a couple of months ago.\n\nTo be fair, there\'s another Edmunds poster here that has the CTS V-Sport (twin turbo V6), which has been flawless for him.'"

Included in this list: Jeep, Chrysler, GMC and, of course, Cadillac. Of course we\xe2\x80\x99ve also experienced Acura, Audi, BMW, Infiniti, Lexus, Mercedes and Volvo, too. But, in response to DeNysschen\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwarning\xe2\x80\x9d to GM\xe2\x80\x99s top brass, I can now reflect on what seems to be a different \xe2\x80\x9capproach\xe2\x80\x9d prospective customers will enjoy when shopping at the dealership of, apparently most, American automotive brands.\n\nHave you ever heard of or seen a TV show called \xe2\x80\x9cWKRP in Cincinnati?\xe2\x80\x9d If so, you will have a somewhat more well-rounded perspective of the Herb Tarlek approach. I want to make sure you understand my remarks are a caricature \xe2\x80\x93 an exaggeration. You see, Mr. Tarlek is the sales manager of the fictional Cincinnati radio station WKRP \xe2\x80\x93 and he is, well, terrible. His behavior qualifies him to be called either a jerk or a jackass. His behavior and customer\xe2\x80\x99s interactions with him often seem vaguely slimy, borderline unethical and disreputable.

You are required to allow your driver\xe2\x80\x99s license to be photocopied and you may even have to produce proof of insurance. Then, the rep gets into the back seat in order to answer any questions that may arise during the test drive.\n\nAnd so it goes \xe2\x80\x93 you can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to get out of there, for, during the test drive the chatter from the back seat is incessant, pressing you for \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99ll it take\xe2\x80\x9d to get you to close the deal today.\n\nCome to think of it, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t as much of a caricature as I had intended.\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if these dealer reps ever shop for cars anywhere else to \xe2\x80\x9csee how it is done elsewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d but the evidence suggests this is not the case.\n\nOn top of way too many dealers, DeNysschen has his work cut out for him \xe2\x80\x93 I suspect he\xe2\x80\x99ll be incredibly popular with the dealers (uh huh).\n\nUnless I knew exactly what I wanted and could pretty much handle the entire transaction over the Internet, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why folks willing and able to plunk down sums often way north of $50,000 put up with this kind of behavior \xe2\x80\x93 oh wait, apparently not enough of them do.\n\nSwallow your pride and see if there\xe2\x80\x99s any openings at Audi, Mr. DeNysschen.

b'August 2015',b'dino001',"b""I'm not against platform sharing, that's a fact of life today. It's about making cars different enough. There are examples of successful platform sharing, such as VAG, where to various degree there are shared components between Skoda, Seat, VW, Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini and Bugatti, but the brands have enough identity and uniqueness between each other. A domestic example of a successful platform sharing would be Cadillac Escalade - regardless how much detest Cadillac's marketing of this vehicle (the commercial with Pharao, Raja, Louis-X??? could easily be in top 3 most offensive and obnoxious ever), it has enough separation from GMC. An example for the opposite also comes from Cadillac - Cimarron.\n\nGM's overall track record of putting different badges on practically identical vehicles makes me, should I say, skeptical. They got better, recently. I think Buicks seem to be regaining their own identity, but seems GM is slowly falling back into its old ways - unrealistic expectations, lots of puffery, and lack of support of their dealers, see Graphic's CTS saga, which seems to stem from multiple dealers' unwillingness to troubleshoot the car without a fault code, which is most likely because GM's refusal to give them enough leeway to work the problem first. They can't win luxury market customers, if their dealers act this way, but they do that because of the toxic relationships. Moreover, there are probably too many stores for the brand to be truly upscale.\n\nSo they trump half million sales target in 5 years, which is high teens growth each year, every year, with currently crashing sales in some key US segments. I understand, big part of the growth is supposed to come from China, which I think is OK, even if recent news suggest a calamity unfolding there (I think it's way overstated).\n\nHow do you grow sales, when in fact you need to shrink the store count and apply more discipline? It's all completely inconsistent. As I said before, it's a ten year project with very difficult first three-four years and no guarantee for a success. They are unwilling to swallow that bitter pill (what's new about that), they'd rather do what they have always done - peacocking, unrealistic baffoonery. Seems like the bankruptcy taught them absolutely nothing. Looks like the new outsider guy fits their old mold quite well.""",b'show previous quotes\nCan you elaborate? Are they lowering prices by large increments? This would certainly be interesting news.'
b'August 2015',b'markcincinnati',"b'It -- perhaps superficially -- appears that Cadillac is emulating the SONY approach. Sony, a few short decades ago was the big buck TV (and later there were many other Sony branded electronics). Back in the day when big name department stores would sell TVs, a shopper could be in selection mode and see a sea of Zenith, RCA, Admiral and even Mitsubishi TVs -- often the Sony family of TVs was separated from the other brands; and, always the Sony brand in whatever size you were shopping for was more expensive. Time passed. Sony proliferated the brand and began lowering prices. Or did the competition creep their prices upward?\n\nEventually Sony showed up in Walmart along side other ""perceived lesser"" brands -- regardless of the price erosion, Sony did keep the image of being the Premium Brand.\n\nLexus, on the other hand, produced a premium automobile, said to be comparable to Mercedes, and charged 20% less. Over time, Lexus was able to inflate the MSRP of the cars to near parity with the premium Germans.\n\nTwo approaches -- both appear to work to carve out market share.\n\nCadillac seems to be working the Sony model -- price the product more dearly, take the chance that the market will perceive the brand in an increasingly positive light -- ""Cadillac is back."" This is time consuming, expensive and probably WILL WORK ""if"" there is sufficient shareholder and executive management patience to ""not quit before the miracle.""\n\nThe Lexus -- Land Grab -- approach also has its merits. In a B2C model, I would assume the Lexus approach seems ""intuitively"" to be lower risk. But, the brand will take a period of time to build up the desired perception. Again, corporate and shareholder patience will be required, but since there will be volume, shareholders may think the ""miracle"" is closer than it may ultimately prove to have been.\n\nYou can\'t enact either approach if your masters fire you though.\n\nThe investors -- a somewhat different group than the shareholders -- probably prefer raising prices, since the brand\'s equity (if the approach works) will certainly be built up.\n\nOddly, in my perception, Audi took the Lexus approach (sort of), but I could argue the ""unintended acceleration"" situation that befell Audi after the 60-Minutes story, FORCED Audi to discount their cars just to remain relevant in the US (remember the days when select prospects received a $5,000 check that could be applied to the Audi 5000 (which became the A6) linup. The approach would seem to be that the MSRP was not discounted, but you were given an up-front rebate.\n\nSo Cadillac is taking the approach of selling cars that are priced higher -- the Sony approach to market share, sort of.\n\nOf course the dealer body has to be convinced along with the customers that this is a long game and worth playing. The dealers, so it appears, are not exactly warming to this approach, however.\n\nWe\'ll see.'",b''

I drive through mostly upper-middle income neighborhoods on my commute, FWIW.\n\nBefore you think I\'ve gone off some rail here, I was having a conversation with a friend about cars and the subject of Cadillac came up -- his comment was that they remain cars that attract ""mature"" owners, retired folk, apparently in his view.\n\nThe article above about the efforts of the new Cadillac President to change the behavior (mentality) of dealers made me think he was onto something. Cadillac dealers don\'t act like Audi, BMW and Mercedes dealers -- and they still paint prices on the windshields of the cars on their lots (I make it a practice to avoid dealers who paint prices on the windshield of the cars on their lot, I fear them, frankly.)\n\nMy perception is that BMW has the youngest drivers of the German Premium Crowd, closely followed by Audi (but that may be because of the Q5\'s success -- and that it would appear Q5\'s have a relatively young owner-set.) Audi, too, with the A3/S3 may be trolling for ever younger owners.\n\nBut, that still leaves me with the observation -- this morning -- that the E and S class Mercs were AWD and all driven by, apparently, Baby Boomers, current Xer\'s and Millennial\'s weren\'t participating this AM, at least.\n\nHere I am 64, driving an S4 -- I guess I should be in what -- an A6 or CTS or perhaps a 5 series or should it be an XTS Cadillac. Wondering what, if any, studies of the age of owners exists -- with all the focus on Millennials and away from us Boomers, these days, it would seem to be some valuable data.\n\nEver notice the current crop of Buick ads wherein the ""little ol\' lady"" remarks ""Oh MY!"" when she is told she\'s in a new Buick. Is that a nod toward the past or is that a convoluted way of suggesting that new Buicks will be appreciated by those of a certain maturity and perhaps even attractive to them?\n\nWondering if part of the issue confronting some car mfgrs, could be they need to make their cars seem to be desired by Millennials.\n\nMaybe on the way home, I\'ll count BMW drivers.\nPer IIHS study:\n\nAge of buyers\nBMW 50.9\nMB 54.6\nCadillac 59.5\nAudi 50.3\nInfiniti 49.4\n\nand the winner for youngest\nLand Rover 47.9\nDodge 48.6\n\nand oldest\nLincoln 61.0\nBuick 60.3\n\nAge of the average buyer is 52.'",b''

To have a really good understanding of what the majority of ages is, you would also need to know the mode, median and range -- to get a better idea of the number(s) that occurs most often. The issue with mean is that a bunch of 45-ish year olds buying a certain car would return an ""average age"" around 45, as you would expect; but, throw in a couple of purchases by some 25 year olds and a few more over 75 and well, depending on the size of the population, you could skew below or above 45 even though the population as individuals is ""over half"" 45-ish.\n\nI was quite surprised to see the average age of BMW buyers was ""THAT OLD!""

I went the Audi route when all my friends went with BMW\'s because #1 the Audi brand had quattro and #2, I always felt you could buy the next higher line of Audi for the same price as the lower line BMW, so I thought the value and performance leader was always Audi (you could say, too, I guess, I was, ahem, more frugal than my BMW lovin\' friends).\n\nBut back to the math -- an average age of 60 does not mean the majority of buyers are over 60.

One makes cash payouts for growing sales; the other attaches up to $700 in dealer bonus money to every vehicle they order from the factory.\n\nDe Nysschen, Cadillac\xe2\x80\x99s president, says those programs must change for dealers to adopt a true luxury mindset, one based on an engaging customer experience, rather than sales volume.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe business model has been structured more for the bigger brands inside General Motors, rather than the small Cadillac brand,\xe2\x80\x9d de Nysschen said here at a test drive event for the media. \xe2\x80\x9cThe luxury business is different.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe said Cadillac is in talks with its national dealer council \xe2\x80\x9cto develop the next generation of what these programs should look like for Cadillac.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s an example of the obstacles de Nysschen faces in reshaping Cadillac\xe2\x80\x99s retail network into something that more closely resembles those of German luxury brands such as BMW or Audi. Most of Cadillac\xe2\x80\x99s more than 900 dealerships are hard-wired to carry far more inventory than other luxury stores, often moving the metal through deep discounts.\n\nA Midwest Cadillac dealer, who didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be identified discussing factory business, believes it would be difficult for many dealers to fathom an incentive program that\xe2\x80\x99s not tied to sales performance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s only one thing that matters, and it\xe2\x80\x99s selling more cars,\xe2\x80\x9d said the dealer, who said he sells a couple dozen Cadillacs a month. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not come in here today to buy more digital stuff for the showroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n(more at the link)'","b""The C300 in the low $50s.

b'July 2015',b'dino001',"b'The trick was in the tax structure, favoring diesels. That tax structure was justified by a doctored science, making the diesel engine look like a savior of the environment (vs. evil gasoline engine) due to lower carbon emissions, with nitrogen and particulate data using emission tests that were set up to produce appearance of much lower emissions than real life. As a result, the measured nitrogen oxide and particulate levels in cities did not go down and they tracked it to the emission test overstating the reduction of those emissions. In essence, if new diesel emission standards were followed using real life tests (similar to those in the US), there would be materially fewer engines certified in the marketplace (just like in the US), and those approved would be much more expensive. Hence the ""con"". There are some other interesting particulars in diesel market in Europe - like particulate filters that are often cut out by rogue drivers, because their replacement is horribly expensive, which defeats the purpose of the filter (this is more Eastern Europe phenomenon than Western). Also, it has been well documented that durability of those new breeds of diesel engines is well below what it was before and the maintenance is horribly expensive. Premature failures of double mass wheels, emission systems (especially in situations of frequent short trips, when particulate filters don\'t have a chance to burn out), increased sensitivity to fuel quality, make those engines equally or even more fragile than gas engines. The old stinker could go for million miles on vegetable or heating oil, the new quiet, ""clean"" diesel, has a lifespan similar or sometimes shorter than the gas engine with higher costs of overhauls. The prices of diesel repairs of those new TDI engines at authorized garages are legendary over there (it\'s not unique to VAG, same happens to MB, BMW, Peugeot, or Renault).\n\nEuropean Commission is trying to rectify the emission situation by tightening the standards to resemble American, but the issue is of course transition time. I believe once new enforcement is in place and costs of engines go up, the proportions of diesel engines in small cars will revert to values similar to those prior the whole craze, which is more than in the US, but much less than today. The move is already happening, primarily due to equalized diesel fuel prices (that used to be much cheaper), observed increased maintenance cost and lower durability (majority of Europeans, even in the West buy cars for eight-ten years, not three or five), but tightening the standard will likely accelerate it.\n\nAmericans never caught that bug, partially due to unrelenting of the US government on nitrogen oxide emission requirements. From what I understand it was also California that was even more ""anti-diesel"" than the feds. When you had fifth of the market excluded, there was little incentive for the manufacturers to even pursue the technology. After 20 years of apparently failed European experiment, it appears this was one of the few times, US/California governments did something right, even if not knowing why.'","b""Let's start with...I've never seen the BMW 3 gt - the 5 gTs that I've seen all look dumpy and for some reason the ones I've seen have smaller 18 inches where 19/20s should be in place.

The old A3 was light enough to be tossable as well and was excellent with the DSG transmission which had great tuning in \'06 (maybe not the tuning a Toyota driver looking for a smooth auto would look for).

Everytime I visit my dealership, I make certain I get in whatever A3\'s are on the showroom floor. I must say, I think a base A3 without any options, seems out of place next to the RS7, S8, A6 TDI, and Q5\'s (and sometimes even an RS8) on the showroom floor, however. The higher contented (with sexier wheels) A3\'s just like the high zoot Q3\'s have no problem being a member of the family, however.\n\nI have twice driven an S3, and I found them to be quick, powerful, almost visceral -- raw and rough around the edges. For $50K, plus $11 for the ear plugs that would be required, however, I would never buy one. Furthermore, firm is one thing, but the S3 in dynamic mode is harsh, more unrefined than any Audi I\'ve ever driven -- until you get the thing above 90MPH, then it starts to make sense.\n\nBut, $50,000+ for an S3 -- which may not be too much considering the content and performance -- seems to put it out of the ""boy racer"" league, unless the ""boy"" has Trump as his last name.\n\nThe current S4 is showing its age, to be sure, but even though there is a new S4 looming in a matter of months, the current S4, for somewhat similar money, still seems far more refined and its supercharged V6 is sublime compared to the S3\'s sturm und drang.\n\nThe S3, to an older fart like me, reminds me of the first time my then boss let me drive his new Porsche 944 turbo. When I found out how much it cost, I just couldn\'t fathom why anyone would subject themselves to that much punishment just to be able to have a car that was supremely capable at triple-digit speeds (in an era when the maximum speed limit was 70MPH -- which we have, once again, returned to here in Ohio, thankfully.)\n\nSo, perhaps the A3 really is the refined ""little"" model deserving of the Audi rings; but, to me, as capable -- at speed and a caution to the wind driving demeanor -- as the S3 is, it seems almost more like something that should have been marketed by VW or had its roughest edges filed down and more sound deadening stuffed into every crack and crevice.\n\nMy remarks, it should be emphasized, pertain mostly to the S3, and entirely to the S3 when it comes to driving impressions.

So fast forward to the E90 335d, was a rocket, 255hp and 413lbs of torque, it's basically the same engine in the 535d and X5 3.5d. The 3.5 liter was too big of engine for the E90, and I think the 2 liter is too small for the F30, BMW has a 2.5 liter 4 cyl oil burner which would give about 20 more HP and about 50 lbs more torque.

Just like the our 320 and 328i.\nThat\'s right. However, there is a real difference between 320i and 328i in output, regardless of the engine size. Moreover, 320i/328i sold here are the same cars sold Europe with only differences due to market certification. However, US-market 328d was a pure badge gimmick. Europeans have always known diesels are more expensive to make, hence they have to be substantially more expensive to buy. Americans don\'t fully understand reasons for such a price premium in diesel-powered cars, so something ""badged"" as lower end (320d) would not sell at price that\'s even higher than mid-level 328i. Hence, 328d, not 320d as everywhere else in the world.\n\nBTW, the European love of diesels is clearly weakening. Not that it\'s gone, but they are not seen as attractive as they used to be. Price of fuel went up so much vs. gasoline (unlike in the US, Europe had had cheaper diesel for decades prior last few years - that was due heavier taxation of gasoline, but now it got offset by higher market pricing due to heavy machinery and generator demand plus more stringent refining requirements), so higher diesel price was offset by better mileage PLUS cheaper fuel. Today, the latter is gone, only mileage is better, so it takes much longer to offset purchase price premium. Diesels are still kings in larger vehicles, like SUVs and crossovers (which are coincidentally getting more popular there), but in smaller and midsize sedans/hatchbacks are getting less and less attractive in diesel versions and the proportions of new car sales are slowly changing.'","b""show previous quotes\n\n\n\nI'll back Dino, our 328d is the euro 320d, same engine..

b'June 2015',b'markcincinnati',"b'New Shoes\n\nThe \'14 S4 I ordered came with the no-cost optional all-season tires. The tire specification was, on my part, deliberate since, living in Cincinnati -- the home of typically ""moderate"" winters -- I know I can\'t get away with ""summer only"" shoes year \'round. My previous A4 with the sport option came with 19"" wheels and summer only tires, which were great except for two things: 1 - they suck at any temperature below 40; and, 2 - the tread life of the Max Performance Summer Only tires that Audi chose was, optimistically not much north of 11,000 miles. This time, I thought I\'d go with an S4 with the A/S\'s -- and I assumed since I was ordering an ""S"" car, the all-season tires would be the best of the best UHP A/S\'s on the market, probably Continentals or Michelins.\n\nBzzz! Thanks for playing, but the correct answer is that the tires on the car were ""H"" rated Grand Touring tires, albeit from Continental. The main characteristic of these GT tires was that they were very quiet. Otherwise they seemed out of place, somewhat, on an S4 -- the phrase ""under-tired"" springs to mind.\n\nWe had, prior to driving my wife\'s SQ5 off the lot had Continental DWS UHP tires put on the 20"" wheels, and these tires were (considering they were UHP A/S\'s) a true pleasure, the best of both worlds, if that is even possible.\n\nSo, here we are about 2 years later (my how time flies), she with 40,000+ miles on the SQ and me with 30,000+ miles on the S4 deciding that we had gotten what we wanted out of the tires on our respective S cars.\n\nMeantime, back in the lab, Continental had updated the DWS tires and renamed them, slightly, DWS 06. Now, I have about 75+ miles on my new DWS 06 tires and the SQ gets its new shoes day after tomorrow.\n\nFor a 100% back-to-back commentary, we\'ll have to wait until we can drive in on DWS\'s and drive out on DWS 06\'s -- but my impressions of these tires on the S4 are from the context of driving in on Grand Touring slightly stiff sidewall tires and driving out on UHP very stiff sidewall tires (and, now that I\'ve passed 50 miles, the slickness is gone).\n\nThe DWS 06\'s if you need (or want) all-seasons have transformed the responsiveness of the S4 from very good to ""I can\'t believe this is even the same car"" great. Additionally, these tires are even quieter than the outgoing GT\'s and even the ""jolts"" felt when hitting potholes are now, somehow, felt as if through some kind of energy absorbing compound (flubber perhaps?)\n\nHere\'s the [current] bottom line:\n\nThese tires were designed to end ""your"" (and my) need to apologize for having all-season tires; there is quite a bit of explanation and detail that goes into what Continental did (or at least how their marketing department explains what they did) -- the sum and substance you can look up, but it all falls under the name ""Sport Plus"" technology.\n\nSPT aims to provide drivers with much more precise handling (than any other UHP A/S tire on the market) and confidence and security on wet and/or slick surfaces, 35% stiffer sidewalls, and an even quieter ride than the DWS all with a 50,000 mile tread life warranty.\n\nI\'d say, thus far, their aim is true. These tires make me REALLY REALLY want to carve up the secondary roads I\'m used to in my neck of the woods.\n\nA set of four, for my S4 was $719.56 and was $908.96 for the SQ5 (S4: 245 x 40 x 18""; SQ5: 255 x 45 x 20"").\n\nI had mine mounted and road-force balanced (plus a 4-wheel alignment) for $200, at the Audi dealer.\n\nI plan to ""drive it like I live"" for at least another 40 - 45,000 miles.\n\nNow I do oh-so-sincerely wish I had remembered to order the Sport Differential.\n\nDOH!'","b""On the s4 for summers I have continentals extream contacts- 19's 255/35 big boys - I can say it's night and day over the 18' winters and with the SD pushing it into a Turn is pure joy.

But the prices on the Audis have gone somewhat stratospheric since I bought my \'98 A4 brand new. At that time the Audi was pretty loaded for the same price as a low end 3-series that was a lot more stripped. Nowadays Audi (to their credit) is seen much more positively than they were in the late \'90s.\n\nThe S4 is available with a 6-speed manual transmission complete with all 3 pedals on the floor! It also amazingly makes the car quite cheap, at under $50K even with extra pricey paint before negotiation. If you have to have all the gadgets and doodads then add $8K.'",b''

If you'd gotten a MB, Audi, or BMW back in 2005, by now it's likely you would have run into some expensive stuff. And I'm not sure it's fair to compare the price of your TL ten years ago with the price of a TLX today. A loaded Audi A3 might suit you better, but it will costs c. $5000 or so more than a comparable TLX.\n\nThe TLX really does have some significant features beyond your TL. It's much safer, gets higher mpg, has 4 wheel steering, as well as a lot of other things just being dreamed of ten years ago.\n\nI liked the handling of our Mazda5 too, but it failed the IIHS crash test.

But with a nice comfortable minivan as the family hauler, I had the freedom and yearning to return to something more on the compact, sportier side for my daily driver. I also was interested in a manual transmission. Such cars are becoming more and more scarce, and the Mazda 3 is a nice choice for those priorities (I also considered a WRX and Civic Si, but liked the overall balance of the Mazda. And my wife already has a GTI, or I probably would have gone that route). The Mazda is very engaging to drive, requiring driver involvement to best take advantage of its (relatively low by today\'s standards) 184 hp through the slick 6-speed manual.\n\nI most frequently post on the CCBA forum, and those that participate there know me (and my habits) fairly well. Lest my current ride be taken as speaking out of place on this particular forum, I have indeed owned several ELLPS vehicles, mostly various 3-series. I\'ve also owned three 5-series, one of each from the past three models (E39, E60 and F10). The F10, while superbly comfortable and sharp-looking, just didn\'t hit the same notes as my earlier BMWs - that wasn\'t surprising based on test drives; I knew full well what I was getting into. I just didn\'t realize how much I\'d be longing for the increased driver involvement.\n\nSo, I went for the total contrast in the Mazda 3.

With the saved fuel, maybe I'll spring for the REVO Stage 1+ pulley upgrade kit that takes the S4 to RS4 levels..... and perhaps beyond...."""
b'June 2015',b'andres3',"b'kyfdx said:\nWhy not just swap cars with the wife?\nWell, I\'d have to trust the wife with the pricey S4, and she doesn\'t have a long commute, but she still works 5 days per week so it would still be gaining miles. She\'s a good driver but I wouldn\'t trust her 100% with the S4 until she completes a HPDE weekend (which so far I\'ve been unsuccessful in getting her to try). Even with me behind the wheel, someone managed to get into a wreck with the S4 by being just horrible.\n\nI\'m not sure the WRX STI would depreciate slower than the S4; especially considering the S4 now has 25,000 miles whereas I\'m assuming you meant get a brand new WRX STI. The first 25,000 miles are the biggest.\n\nIf I could live with a stick for a daily driver on congested freeways, The STI would be right up my alley. Since I don\'t want a stick for daily duty, Subaru is out until they develop a good dual clutch auto-manual transmission. At least they don\'t\' embarrass the STi with a CVT option. The Golf R would be a good alternative...., but even if the S4\'s extra weight keeps it from handling as well, the tuning options on the S4 are quite extraordinary. You can basically turn it into an AWD muscle car that handles reasonably great considering its weight.\n\nThe other consideration is the wife is starting to itch for a new vehicle after 8 years with the Civic. Something roomier would be nice since we have a 19-1/2 month old now, and possible wishes for a 2nd in the near future. The Golf SportWagon just surpassed the Forester in the running... TDI; great mileage, and right now diesel is cheap. It is ""JUUUUUSSSST"" big enough with the significantly elongated rear end, and I\'m not sure any vehicle is as space efficient as the new Golfs/GTI\'s.\n\nThe S4 has performed exemplary as the Sport Sedan disguised as a Family Sedan thus far. 2 kids is pushing it though; but maybe not until at least one of them is much older. The worst thing is being told you should go rear-facing with the car seat up to 2 years. Rear-facing takes up MUCH MORE room than front-facing, and I think the statistics that say it\'s 5X safer are skewed by really bad drivers.'",b'Why not just swap cars with the wife?'

They look at many of the Asian cars for that reason. \n\nYou seem to have a hard time looking at things from a different perspective than your own.\nI do like German cars -- but I also liked my Acura TL, often comparing it favorably to an S4. Assuming you\'re correct regarding the ""popularity"" of VW for the reasons you cite (and I am taking your assertions as accurate), it is a shame. Since the cars\' reliability and/or durability and the dealer experiences apparently suck, I can understand their waning sales. Yet, this Jetta is solid, the transmission is great and the steering is communicative. Now, in the course of 700 miles, assuming I have no reliability issues, my perception of the greatness of the car will probably remain unchanged.\n\nVW should be ashamed of itself if the reliability and dealer experience isn\'t corrected sooner rather than later.\n\nSpeaking of perspectives, I also enjoyed our Infiniti -- kept it 39 months, and other than a new set of tires, the thing was as close to flawless (in terms of the driving experience, reliability and durability) as one would expect. I did test the Q50S, the Lexus 350 F-Sport (and even ordered one) -- so I can understand and support several non-German cars as great. My specific rant pertaining to Toyotas was just that, remarks pertaining to Toyota, not all non-German cars.\n\nI do test drive a lot of cars, and I rent a lot of cars -- the rental experiences typically allow me to drive hundreds of miles in a given example. The Toyotas typically and specifically are a huge disappointment -- which confuses me considering their apparent sales successes. Hondas, to name another Asian brand, on the other hand, do not suffer from this good enough approach. The Hyundai Genesis, and Kia Optoma too are examples of cars that certain seem to not be satisfied with a good enough approach.\n\nA few days ago when I started this ""I\'m disappointed in"" Toyota thread, I did only mention Toyota and that still stands. The phrase, ""I hate Toyotas"" is simply my way, in this forum of supporting the notion that good is the enemy of great.\n\nThe good news is, it certainly seems that a lot of folks are participating and voicing their opinions on this and other subjects, which, from my perspective is a good thing, what this ""tool"" (the Edmunds forum) is all about.'","b""I rented a Challenger and a Fiat 500 for a couple of trips to see how I liked them.

Their interest level is harder to ascertain, but, assuming you are correct that 95% have no interest, I would be made both sad and fearful. I assume you assume they -- the 95% -- have no interest because . . .um, they have never been exposed to greatness (at THAT particular price point)?\n\nLet me give you an irrelevant comparison -- while growing up, my mother fixed this nasty-tasting ""entree"" she called salmon patties. They looked like a cross between a hamburger and what, today, I think of as a mostly-crab, crab-cake. The taste, after frying was, well, horrible. But, hey, it\'s Friday so well it was either fried smelt or salmon patties; so after a while I actually ate the salmon patties entirely. I don\'t think I ever liked them, but I did learn to tolerate them. Eventually, in a sentimental, not logical or rational, moment I was told I actually said (I deny this) ""salmon patties are good."" Perhaps, salmon patties are good compared to, er, hmm, DIRT!\n\nTime and tide, time and tide -- and I eat (in college) at a nice restaurant and the special of the day is salmon. First off, when it comes, I barely recognize it, and then when I taste it, I know for sure ""this sure as hell isn\'t salmon!"" Salmon is great, I love salmon -- I had grown to accept canned salmon [allegedly] as good.\n\nHow much is an Avalon or a Camry? Don\'t answer that, the point is not how much it costs it\'s that for THAT much money, it ought to be possible to build a great car, not just a good one that has a lot of stuff for the money. Now, if the stuff is what actually makes it great -- and NOT the driving experience or its capabilities -- well, then I don\'t know what we\'re all talking about here. We COULD add navigation and blu-tooth to a Trabant I would assume, but that wouldn\'t make it even a good car, it would still be a bad car that just happen to have sat-nav.\n\nI don\'t think everyone needs or wants or should need or want an ELLPS -- I do think we all deserve to know what real salmon tastes like, so to speak.

I think they continue working on this engine and it probably improved since the introduction. I pushed it harder this time and it produced a decent low-pitch grunt that I didn't hear before. I also proved fairly quick. I was skeptical for long time, but I'm warming up a little to a possibility of giving up on the six-cylinder for the economy (both price and fuel). The steering in 428 was also a bit better than 335 (there are wider wheeltrack and same wheelbase, also reportedly slight suspension differences between 3- and 4-series). LCI could not have come fast enough, let's hope some of that steering feedback is restored.

If you ever watched Top Gear episode on Hilux (Euro version of Tacoma), you'd absolutely say that Toyota makes great cars - for those who have particular expectations, vastly different from yours. To hate Toyota the way you describe it, is to hold all those people in contempt and declare your life priorities as the only ones worth considering, which I think is too far. Some people simply care about price, fuel economy and durability, cheap maintenance. Toyota absolutely excels in those. Those people buy their vehicles to keep them for 10 years, they'd rather spend the money somewhere else. Those are valid life choices, regardless how hard you find that to fathom.

I always felt that the 6 cyl twin scroll turbo was uner rated to begin with. That said, I had the performance pack upgrade in mine, which according to BMW, upped the HP and torque ratings by about 20 each. So, not sure if they just applied those engine management changes to the current motor, or they did something more ""physical"" to massage the engine..\n\nThe thing that will haunt the 3/4 series is the continued interiors they design. You look at the ATS, the A4, the C300, and the BMW interior needs some serious rework. I liked mine (2011). But, it could have used a shot of style. Even with the new models, the interior could use more panache, especially considering what the competition is doing.\n\nLD....my sister, who traded her 8 year old Jag in for a Mercedes was bemoaning not going back to Jaguar for her new car.

More important than ""things"" are the other choices we make -- perhaps it is children, college funds (for your kids or for your MBA or JD or whatever). The thing is very few of us can ""have it all."" And, even some who literally could have it all, don\'t want it all. My best friend worked hard at a manufacturing company and eventually became the president of the company -- he never, in his entire life, has owned a new car. He searches -- it seems like all the time, to me -- for the ""cherry"" car. He finds the mythical little old lady or little old man who has a 2005 Cadillac with 15,000 original miles on it and that\'s what he goes for. He is as passionate about cars -- subscribes to ALL of the magazines -- as I am.

We probably could afford (that is the deal could be done) for an Audi RS7 ($120,000 MSRP). We\'d have to settle on other things were we to go for the RS.\n\nInstead we decided to set our sites on far less expensive cars (mine was $57K, hers $65K), we bought hers and leased mine. The burden for both is $1,400 per month, all in.\n\nOur next door neighbor has a new 750 BMW -- and a Camry -- the Bimmer costs as much as both of our cars combined.

b'May 2015',b'markcincinnati',"b'Someone here wrote that the German practice of a new model designation (with Audi it is B, C, D, etc) is to release a new model every 8 years with a ""refresh"" at year 5 or 6. This is a practice that, I assume, comes from the desire to amortize development costs (and, in theory, lower the MSRPs) over a long time horizon.\n\nThe issue is, car magazines (and the market itself) can latch onto the descriptor: ""Long in the tooth."" I have a 2014 A4 (B8) sub designated S4. I had a 2009 A4 2.0T Prestige that I took delivery of in 2008. A NEW 2015 A4/S4 is essentially the same as a 2008 available A4. There is, far as I know, no new ordering guide for 2016 A4\'s available yet.\n\nBut, this is the time of year, typically, that you can order a NEW A4 and what will arrive is the NEXT MY. Far as I know -- the operative phrase -- if you go into an Audi dealer and order up a new S4 Prestige with a bunch of options on it, what will arrive is a 2015 B8 version, not the eagerly anticipated B9 morphed model.\n\nAt the rate of change that is POSSIBLE, it would seem to me that an 8 year model to model cycle may now be too long. No wonder the A4 is selling poorly -- at this price point, folks want THE NEXT, not THE CURRENT, especially if the CURRENT is, literally, 8 years old, no matter how effective the mid-cycle refresh has been.\n\nNow, I have had my 2014 about a year and a half. I have 25K miles on it. I love this car. I am thinking about replacing the tires thus enjoying the car for the next 35K miles with improved shoes.\n\nI am hoping on a major evolution in the A4 model line as it goes from B8 to B9, and I guess the thing to do is to get the NEW version within the first 2 or 3 MY\'s into the -- apparent -- 8 year cycle.\n\nI assume my current S4\'s durability is not in question -- thus far it has been bullet proof. I will be having the car ""rejuvinated"" at a local detail shop next week. I an assuming this process will do what the name suggests. And, I am looking forward to keeping the car beyond the end of its lease term.\n\nSubsequently, I plan -- plans are nothing, planning is everything -- to buy the next time out, but who knows, things may change. Yet, I still assume I will have to order the car to my specs, but there\'s the fun, it\'s like getting a new car TWICE within 90 days.\n\nAnd, BTW, someone wrote that cars on the lot are less expensive than ordered cars -- I guess there are exceptions to every ""rule"" -- but in my experience an ordered car is typically hundreds less than a car on the lot; and I\'ve never had a dealer or dealer sales rep indicate anything other than a great willingness to take an order. My rep says he would be fine -- financially, I assume -- if everyone ordered and used the dealership for test drives; this way, he says, he could have more variety available for prospects to test drive.\n\nI don\'t know anything about ""ordering"" Hondas, I would no more do that than I would order a new electric can opener, however. I\'m partial to Oster\'s, if you care.'",b'Looks like a new addition is coming to the ELLPS family: https://www.yahoo.com/autos/first-drive-2017-jaguar-xe-a-cat-that-purrs-and-118121064842.html'

It also ignores dealer cash incentives that are tied to inventory and taking a delivery in a specific time frame, usually within a month or less. No dealer would commit to a price reduced by a dealer\'s cash that expires in fifteen days for a car with 8-10 week lead, not eligible for that cash. The incentive may or may not be extended.

b'May 2015',b'markcincinnati',"b'I have nothing against Hondas -- I did have an Acura TL SH-AWD for a time and thought it the Japanese S4 alternative.\n\nHonda sells an incredible number of units per year -- they offer, apparently, a large number of customers and prospective customers what they want or what they are willing to settle for. That last declaration can be applied to Hondas and Acuras, VW\'s and Audis and Nissans and Infinitis and Toyotas and Lexus cars.\n\nTo some extent, we all settle.\n\nMy opinion, and it is a ""data point"" opinion, is that folks who go for Hondas instead of Acuras, etc, etc, settle more, probably, because they just aren\'t into cars that much. I work with folks who lease new Corollas every 24 months -- they proclaim in word and deed that their 8 mile per day round trip drive isn\'t worth getting a Lexus IS350 F-Sport AWD. They see no merit in cars, hoping instead for public transportation that would eliminate their ""need"" for a car altogether/ Across the hall is another ""cars are a necessary evil"" individual who is happy to buy a well worn but reliable mini-van opting instead for a new fridge, dishwasher, range and washer and dryer. We also have an empty nester two high income couple who love Acuras. The last player in our small group loves Minis and is as passionate about the brand as I am about Audis.\n\nIt takes all kinds.\n\nI would not, on purpose, go to Honda for a new car -- I did dip my toe into Honda in 2012. The Accord line is nice -- but personally, I found it bland, uninvolving but well built with a smooth power train.\n\nI am 63, at this point in my life I find myself repeating ""life\'s too short"" whenever I consider any purchase over some at the time appropriate sum.\n\nEvery appliance we have purchased -- if we settled too much -- fails quickly, either literally or in its utilitarian aspect. We bought three Whirlpool dishwashers (top of the line) and the damn things kept breaking (thankfully in their warranty period), then when they broke again out of warranty, the repair costs were often about 2/3rds the cost of a new dishwasher. Dishwasher number four was a Bosch -- the thing is a tank and is so quiet its damn near impossible to know if it is running or not.\n\nThe point is settle on the things that are not important to you, settle less and less on things that are important to you. If you are ""into"" (whatever that means to you) cars, you\'ll probably be compelled toward the ELLPS and LPS models many of us go on about here. If you\'d rather have a new Viking range and a new Sub-zero fridge and so on, and aren\'t made of money, well your choice is much more clear -- go for the great stuff in the kitchen and the good stuff in the garage. I have no quarrel with that.\n\nIf you want a larger portfolio and are willing to drive something less than an LPS car, go for that.\n\nSettle on the things you don\'t care about and don\'t settle on the things you do.\n\nThis is not the entire extent of what I have learned in 63 years, but it did, at the time (way back when) come to feel like an epiphany.\n\nThat is why I say: Drive it like you live..\n\nSo far, I do not have to settle on a Honda or a Toyota -- but it doesn\'t mean if you do that I don\'t respect your decision (unless you are ""over-settling"" -- you\'ll easily recognize this if you constantly complain about your new car or whatever).'",b''

b'May 2015',b'graphicguy',"b'I live near a Mercedes dealer in the county just north of the Greater Cincinnati area. As such, I receive mailings all the time from the dealer, given they captured my contact info when I was helping my sister buy a C class several months ago.\n\nKnowing that the ""NEW"" C Class was on its way, I told her to hold on for 6-8 months to look at the ""all new"" 2015 C. But, everyone knew the new C was just around the corner, so the dealers and Mercedes were really aggressive pricewise in selling the \'14s.\n\nAnyway, got an email from one of the new sales people at the local Mercedes dealer that was obviously culled from my company\'s database showing what I\'m sure is the only person who works for my company within a 250 mile area (probably bigger). They were having some private showing of a GTS. I ended up on the list to attend a ""look see"".\n\nClearly, they didn\'t have access to my salary info if they thought I was a target customer for the AMG GT-S. But, I had heard about it, read about it, thought it was ""cool"" so yeah....I\'ll eat free canapes if they let me sit in it. IF they let me drive it....even better.\n\nI\'ll cut to the chase. They didn\'t let me drive it. Got to sit in it, though. I hate the new ""flat"" paint jobs these cars have. But, I guess the very high end cars are all getting them, Mercedes AMG is no exception.\n\nCan\'t really see paying as much for a car as a starter home costs, but if you have the disposable income to do so, you\'d probably be hard pressed to find a nicer car.\n\nAs I wandered from the hoard who was engulfing shrimp cocktail and pate, I spied a humble C-Class outside. Steel Grey with Red Leather (the real stuff....not the fake stuff Mercedes tries to tell you is ""better than leather"" (it\'s not). This wasn\'t the 400, but the lowly 300 with a turbo 4 cyl. Sales guy spots me, asks me what I thought. Told him I liked the color combo better than any I\'d seen so far.\n\nAt the Autu Show this past winter, they were showing one that was black on black without the sport package....pretty dour. This one, was quite different. Very pretty. Sales guy has keys and a dealer tag before I knew he had left. ""Go for a spin?"".\n\n""I\'m not in the market"".\n\nSales-""I\'d rather take you for a test drive and hope you remember me when you are in the market.""\n\n""Fair enough"".\n\nIt\'s taken me awhile, but I\'ve finally wrapped my head around sports sedans with 4 cyl. Actually, these turbo motors really do amaze me. They\'re torquey. More fuel efficient. Lighter. And generally, they may not be faster, but just more fun to drive than the recent 6 cyl cars I\'ve had recently. Truth told, they\'re pretty damned quick in their own right.\n\nThis one is no different. I don\'t know the specs, but it\'s typical. No turbo lag that I could ascertain. Quick off the line. Pulled hard over a broad RPM range. It was quieter than the growl my CTS gives off (which I like). 7 speed trans that you have to goad a bit to downshift, but steering wheel paddles help with this. It\'s smoother than my CTS trans, but I\'ve got one less gear and my trans is already pretty smooth already (GM KNOWS how to make a good automatic trans).\n\nC Seats I really liked...even better than my ""go to"" sport seats in the TL SH AWD. The Benz felt tailored to me. I think most of that is due to the very soft leather (again, no hard ""pleather"") and the crazy amount of adjustments you can make to them....including power thigh extenders.\n\nMy CTS seems faster, but again, the C is no slouch. CTS suspension is geared more towards handling. C is geared more towards ride, but certainly could hold its own. At least that\'s the first impression over what was a 20 minute test drive.\n\nNow, my CTS interior is no slouch in the build and materials category. Real wood, leather, suede, aluminum, is well put together, inside and out...probably the best GM has ever done with any car they\'ve built........EVER!\n\nC Class is over the top, especially at the price point. Again, real leather, aluminum and the switches were the same as I just had seen in the AMG just 30 minutes earlier. They felt the same, too. Mercedes leather is better than Cadillac leather, which is really good in and of itself. Porous wood, is better than CTS polished wood (which again, is really, really good).\n\nI didn\'t like the new trend of the ""screen as an afterthought"". Cadillac does a much better job. I don\'t like the trans ""stalk"", but understand that\'s a Mercedes trade mark (really?). My CTS is bigger, but hte C felt more comfortable.\n\nFinal thoughts. The C stickered for right around $50K. Their discount, my corporate discount, probably put it somewhere in the $44K-$45K range. At that price? A very compelling car. The interior is what would sell it. It\'s competitive everywhere else...drive, handling, performance...with the 3, A, etc. ATS is edgier (as is my CTS).\n\nMaintenance? Included with Cadillac for 4 years. Way cheaper than Mercedes after warranty period, too.\n\nI\'d consider one on my next pruchase...probably put it near the top.'",b'Interesting choice of engines too. a 2.0L Turbo Diesel 4 cyl & a 3.0 Super Charged Gasser V6.

In ten years, I assume the number will be smaller as my needs, like my hairline, continue to recede.\nMark.....all good points.\n\nI was just having this conversation with my best friend. He has a $70K \'15 Corvette, that for the most part, sits in his garage gathering dust. He drives a new Suburban every 2 years....I\'ll assume those are at least in the $50K range with discounts...probably closer to $65K with the new version. His wife drives an Infiniti M something....assume mid $50s on that. So, in short, he has roughly $185K tied up in vehicles,,,,,,,RIGHT THIS MOMENT.\n\nHe\'s in my tax bracket. Not Soros money, nor even failed Silicon Valley start up money. But, enough that we\'re not too worried about going into a dealership and buying something like a brand new Corvette as an impulse buy.\n\nHis philosophy? Spend it all while alive and healthy. He has no kids. He was an only child. So, outside of his wife, he really has no other outlet to spend his money (or even save for college tuition, teen insurance rates, etc). In short, the only thing he has to worry about is staying relatively healthy.\n\nSome worry and sweat every purchase, whether it\'s that new leather recliner, or whether to buy a Honda or an Acura. They have kids. They have huge tuition bills staring at them. I get that. I\'ve been there.\n\nI\'m 10 years before I think about retirement. So, that\'s something I think about, but certainly doesn\'t occupy a lot of my time. I think I\'m good, but who knows what will happen over the next decade.\n\nWould it make a major financial lifestyle change if I bought a Z06 Corvette? Nope. The only question I\'d ask myself is ""what else could you do with that money?""\n\nI see my son, who has a good job in IT. He works for a major University, so his job is secure, probably as long as he wants to stay there. He\'s wanting a new WRX. He\'s fretting over how it will affect his lifestyle currently. As I told him, budget it up. If it would get in the way of your savings plan as it stands right now (I actually showed him how to budget for just about everything and anything), then don\'t do it. If you can do all the things you\'re doing now, put all the eggs in the baskets you\'ve set up. then go for it.\n\nWho I feel for are the folks who are busting their tails to make ends meet. Their budget is sliced so thin, that tomorrow is only a hope that they\'ve got enough to feed their family healthily. If their 10 year old Caravan has a major issue, it will mean a large change in a lifestyle that can ill afford any negative changes and is begging for anything positive. They can\'t afford a new car (although dealers would love to get them in and finance them at their high rates). They\'re the ones who need a new car the most.\n\nOn the other end of that spectrum, there\'s my other colleague, who has a 12 year old TL....250K miles. We both get a healthy car allowance....BUT...only if the car is 3 years old or less and is on their ""list"" of approved vehicles. He bought the TL used a decade ago and is having fits about how much ""cars cost"" today. If he could drive a used Tercel and pocket the car allowance, he\'d be happy. And yes, he can afford any car he wanted....including those $100K cars you speak about.\n\nI fall in the middle. I like the nicer cars. but have my own definitions on what I\'ll spend money on. I like nice cars, but not ones that cost $60K (unless that $60K car was an overwhelming value at that price). I\'ll put a limit set at $55K. I\'ve long given up the notion of any car as something that\'s anything more than an expense to me. It\'s a depreciating asset. Truthfully, it\'s not even an asset in my mind. Plain and simple, it\'s an expense.'",b'The F30 gets the LCI'

What I'm tired of (and I owned a Jetta in the late '80) is the ultra high cost of parts and even more so the poor dealer service network and poor reliability. High parts cost is ok if the experience of the car is good and they are reliable. So I really liked the late '90's/early 2000's VWs and nearly bought a Passat as it was much like my '90 Audi A4 - just a bit bigger but still almost as nice in size - practially an ELLPS. Fast forward to the later 200x's and the Passat is bigger, relatively cheaper, and softer. It's more like an American car but still poor reliability, expensive parts, and VW service network. That IMHO is why VW has missed the boat. And also agree that they are slow to respond.""","b""you still can't get anything you want with a domestic. Maybe some more packages or stand alone options.

The spirit of what I was saying was simply that cars, like houses, are very expensive purchases, yet we seem (to me, and I am only speaking for me) to buy these expensive durable goods with (what I perceive) not much discriminating thought put into the expenditure.\n\nBut, perhaps the system is set up that way -- folks go to the auto dealership thinking they want a dark blue metallic car with an ecru interior but, for the sake of -- what? -- expediency end up with gloss black paint and a light gray interior.\n\nAll I am saying (about myself) is I grew up in the 1960\'s when a brand new Chrysler Newport was under $4,000 -- which, for my parents, was a HUGE purchase. Since it (the 1963 Chrysler Newport) was my parent\'s first new car ever, they wanted (god knows why) seafoam metallic (a kind of medium green with a shiny tinge to it), automatic transmission, an AM radio with a rear seat speaker, a rear window defroster and power steering and power brakes.

It can be canceled. The owner is paying for bunch of iron on their lot so this future order (that may be canceled) is not paying off any existing unit yet, but if you had bought today one out of those on the lot, the bank gets the check and interest stops. The system is absolutely geared toward here and now and the players adjusted to it. The benefit is lower prices, the drawback - limited selection and reliance on guesses from dealers\' and regional reps\' what will sell in what proportions. They essentially already decided for us what we want.\n\nThe German brand salespeople are usually well trained to accept orders and act like they\'re happy about it (even if they preferred to sell us something from the lot). Moreover, they generally have a system where every car has an order behind it (it usually is a sales manages, sometimes actual customer). They even have some ""special order"" options (like colors) that require actual end customer for production (managers sometimes create a virtual Joe Smith to work the system).\n\nTry make an order at a Honda dealer - you get rolling eyes, laugh, dismissal, or even anger.

The thing is, however, the thought is you must pay to play when you order a car either in an unpopular color or with options deleted that will make the car, er, ""unmarketable.""\n\nIncreasingly, even the German cars are only purchased ""off the lot"" -- as we Americans seem to want immediate gratification -- so cars are ordered that the dealer feels confident will sell within some reasonable time frame, thus not incurring interest charges that are above the planned amount.\n\nThe off the lot mentality, too, is why so many cars in stock are black, gray, silver with black interiors, etc. We\'ve apparently decided that we want our cars with black paint and black leather -- it is very difficult to find cars with more imaginative color combinations, or without certain packages.\n\nI don\'t fault the dealers, though, car buying is: test drive and buy on Saturday and, if possible, drive it home on Saturday.\n\nMy wife\'s friend bought a very nice new car, about $70K before discount. A long Saturday test drive, followed by an offer, followed by a pick up on Monday. Wham bam, thank you m\'am.\n\nNow, the car in question looked like the Batmobile (well, sort of) and it is a very very nice ride. But, this method of picking out a $70K car seems like settling. I guess it is possible the car was configured EXACTLY as wanted, so ordering it was unnecessary.\n\nBut, why not take the time to ""build"" the car just like many of us build the houses we live in, the suits we wear, etc; and, then wait for the thing to be fabricated to your specifications?\n\nClearly, there is something wrong with me.\n\nI am thinking that I purchased ONE new Audi off the lot and purchased one ""previously owned"" Audi (essentially off the lot, too) out of 32 of them. I kept the new one I bought off the lot for less than 12 months because it wasn\'t equipped to my liking. See, something\'s just not right with me.\n\nThe last time I was in Germany was 2005 -- at that time, the Audi dealer in Munich I spoke with said they keep no inventory other than cars for test drives because ""everyone"" orders their cars. Well, sure, I thought, you\'re in Munich -- but the same thing is true in Zurich. Folks decide to buy a car, work with a dealer rep to order the car, wait 4-6 weeks and pick it up -- getting EXACTLY the car they wanted. Is this still European practice?\n\nAnyway, if you don\'t want a sunroof, order the damn car without it -- it\'s your money after all.'"
b'April 2015',b'markcincinnati',"b'If you delete the sunroof do you get a CREDIT?\n\nI\'ve seen some of the ""delete"" options, and while they allow it, they don\'t change the price.\n\nI purchased an Audi 5000CS quattro some time ago (it had 15,000 miles on it). The window sticker was in the glove box -- the car had wool seats (with a delete leather seats, noted on the sticker). I liked the seats, even though I am not a fan of seats that cannot simply be wiped with a damp cloth -- but I bought the car previously owned, after all.\n\nI assume wool seats must be the default in Europe, but this was not a gray market car -- it was a regular US spec 5000CS with pearl paint (optional) and delete leather seats (a no cost option).\n\nSince sunroofs are only ""standard"" in some markets, I have to assume that the decision to include a sunroof in the US is the fact that we Americans want sunroofs and EXPECT them and perhaps would not like seeing a sunroof (which is a right, after all) with a line item with a charge on it on the window sticker.\n\nI wonder if there is an economy of scale making the bundling of options for a particular market a way to both increase profits for the US (for instance) arm of the company and to somehow suggest that the content of the car is actually higher than competing models.\n\nFriend of my wife just went test driving Audi and BMW. Configured two cars as close to identical as the web site configurators would allow; the BMW\'s MSRP rose more quickly than the Audi\'s, even though they seem to be comparable when ""stripped"" (which is due to the fact that the Audi has more content than the BMW in base form). Then the BMW surges past the Audi when the option boxes are checked off in an attempt to keep the cars as close as possible in terms of their equipment levels.\n\nI don\'t know if anything was actually proven, but her friend ended up with a 2016 A6 3.0T Sline Prestige for about the same price as a 4-cylinder BMW 5 series with a couple fewer options. The BMW seemed to shoot up in price as the attempt to content it like the Prestige package moved forward.\n\nBut this may be an example that isn\'t typical -- maybe the BMW is comparable assuming you don\'t put ventilated seats, heads up display, sport package and LED headlights on it -- I find the configurators take a lot of work to pull together comparable equipment levels (and maybe that\'s the point.)\n\nI tried doing this with a Porsche Macaan vs an Audi SQ5 -- the Porsche dealer said the differences in price for content were very small. My calculations came up with about a $15,000 difference. Maybe that is what Porsche figures is a small difference.\n\nHell, at these price points, price isn\'t really the main selling factor -- after all, if what we wanted was a lot of bang for our bucks, we\'d all buy KIA\'s, yes?'",b''

It may be true for some brands, where options and packages are limited. Not so much in BMW or Benz (even if their options are limited vs. Europe, they still come with plenty of available combinations). Probability of finding my favorite combination within 300 miles is basically null. I\'d like 435i Grand Coupe with sport line (but not M-sport - ripoff, well let\'s say ""too expensive for value"") with red exterior, black upholstery w/ red stitching, dark burl walnut wood trim, premium package, technology package, driver assistance package, harman kardon sound (negotiable), but no lighting package (ripoff), I\'m flexible on wheels. No. of cars within 300 mile - ZERO. There is nothing even close, like one option missing/too many. Even compromising on the color and/or upholstery and/or trim still does me no good. So no, ""pretty much anything"" does not apply. Sport line is rare, there may be one or two units per five local dealerships - of course in a completely wrong configuration. It just so happens that my perception of value seems to be completely different than sales managers of those dealerships. I see Sport line as a highest value, because it gives you seats and suspension without all that other fluff - and you get gorgeous red on black stitching (if you choose that color) to boot. They seem to think that if you want the suspension and seats, you must also want all those other aesthetic additions and accents that BMW charges you extra 2 grand. I disagree, but who am I?\n\nSame thing, Benz - there may be 50 or 100 units in C-class on a local major dealer lot (TB Mercedes), yet ZERO (literally) with real leather, all that fake stuff. This is how it were at some point, anyway - perhaps today they have one, who knows. That\'s what people buy, they say. It may be true. Leather is expensive at Benz and the fake stuff looks ""just as good"" - so they say. I wouldn\'t know, as there isn\'t even a single one to inspect.'"

As a moderator here at Edmunds, I help folks with lease numbers (MF and residual).

But, should I find myself in the market for a car with that price range, I\'d have no problem ordering it to my exact specs.'","b""Here's another issue with the current American Way of buying: there is virtually no opportunity to experience certain options, since the dealer rarely stocks cars with (for example only) Blind Spot Monitoring or Top View Camera, etc."""

b'April 2015',b'markcincinnati',"b'When you\'re bored . . .\n\n. . . and you\'re 63 and your wife loves driving -- ""every mile\'s a smile"" -- and it is a truly beautiful day in SW Ohio (Saturday last), what do you do? Answer: You take cars out and drive them.\n\nI must admit, I wasn\'t all that keen on driving a dealer\'s car, especially since I know and they know and I know they know I know, that neither of us are currently in the market; but my sales rep, Greg, had a 2015 S5 with the Sport Differential option (and 60 miles on the OD) just sitting there, and, well, he knows my wife doesn\'t have any experience behind the wheel of an Audi S car with torque vectoring (TV). The rest as they say was inevitable.\n\nWe went out for a long drive on familiar twisty (and in great condition) secondary roads. I went first at my wife\'s insistence to somewhat demonstrate what rear torque vectoring added to a rear-biased (60%) AWD car equipped with max performance 35 series summer only tires can do, out of the box.\n\nAs I am familiar with the road where a sign indicating 15 MPH (right turn corner) is the correct speed, according to the Ohio DOT, to navigate the turn, I know my non-TV equipped S4 can take said curve @ 45 MPH. Therefore I assume that with the summer-only super sticky tires (I do not have these) and the TV option, the TV equipped car ought to be at least good for another 5 - 10 MPH without drama.\n\nI was proven correct in that I easily took this ""curve"" at 54 MPH with help from what feels like it could be ""The Hand of God."" Entering the corner ""hot"" (but maintaining, NOT accelerating) was a little unnerving at first, but when I reached the apex of the corner, I dialed in about an inch more lock and a like amount of throttle.\n\nThe rear end of the car was seemingly grabbed by a giant foam rubber hand and the car ""carved"" right through he corner as if something or some one had gripped the rear quarter panels low to the ground and simply pushed me through the corner, virtually drama free. Speed? Yes? A bit of a rush coming out of the apex of the curve? Oh hell yes!\n\nNext up a left hand curve with a bit of a an opposite (from the expected and helpful) bank meaning the car was not helped at all by the highway engineer\'s decision to have the apex of the curve have a crown rather than a scallop. Once again, almost counter-intuitively I entered the curve hot, waited for the apex where I cut the wheel to the left (a bit) while simultaneously punching the gas ""with feeling.""\n\nAgain, the invisible hand pushed the car, as if it were on rails, through the horribly under-engineered road.\n\nA couple of nice, virtually deserted straight-a-ways where the supercharged engine at full throttle thrilled, rounded out the first half of the ""test.""\n\nUp next, my wife -- our idea was this: I drove the outbound route and she would drive the return route, retracing my steps (in the opposite direction). My left curves were her rights, and so on.\n\nOnce she got the hang of cutting the wheel just a bit more than seemed ""natural"" at the apex and punching the gas, she too was calling TV the hand of god.\n\nI guess, other than sharing this with y\'all, I would invite you to experience a powerful car with rear biased torque split, aggressive summer tires and a ""sport differential."" Someone once said, ""nothing else even comes close.""\n\nI am ""OK"" with not having a car equipped with torque vectoring -- but, given a choice, I will never get another car (on purpose) without it. The Acura\'s SH-AWD is a great piece of tech; but, the issue is: It is installed on a car with a 90%/10% f/r torque split and the ability to shift a maximum of power to the rear of just 50%.\n\nSo while I admire and recommend only getting an Acura equipped with SH-AWD, if you\'re looking at the brand, I can attest that, good as it is, nothing even comes close to the implementation of TV in the S5 I drove this weekend.\n\nToo bad I\'m not in the market -- for an S4 thusly equipped would be sick.\n\nDrive it like you live.\n\nMark, reporting from somewhere in Cincinnati -'","b'show previous quotes\nLOL, there are always hazards of driving convertibles...'"

b'April 2015',b'markcincinnati',"b'How is it that a power-plant that outputs, say, 250 pound feet BEFORE chipping and 340 AFTER not putting stress on the transmission originally designed for the original torque output (with some margin built in for durability)? The thing is, such upgrades of blown engines often do produce massive torque improvements (at low RPM\'s) -- and initially there usually does not appear to be any negative consequences of the added twist. But, over time, won\'t the transmission almost be expected to have a reduced lifespan?\n\nMy point would be ""let the buyer beware"" -- go with a factory approved chip provider, if one exists. If Dinan does not risk the warranty, go with them for your BMW upgrad; if APR has no affiliation with Audi, well, be guided accordingly and put about $15,000 in a bank account called ""Just In Case"" -- or just get the uprated model usually offered by the manufacturer in the first place.\n\nThis (the above) is coming from a been there done that perspective -- my wife was becoming a sitting duck everytime she attempted to merge with high speed traffic.

But now, Tahoes are a $65-$75K step down from $80K Escalades, So, not sure I can say they\'re in any way shape or form, economical.\n\nSo, if I keep my CTS long enough, perhaps I can really see if GM and Cadillac have changed.\n\nAll that said, I mentioned a few months ago that I had tested an S3. Suspension was way too stuff for my tastes (a whole other level stiffer than my previous S4). Ran into one of the guys who originally helped me at the Audi dealership on the east side of town. He recognized me immediately (probably because of all the time spent at his dealership trying to get Audi to fix my car). It took me awhile to place him, but I knew him.\n\nKind of funny because I think at the time he was the Audi sales manager. He said he\'s doing something with one of the other dealerships in the dealer group. He was the ONLY one who at least tried to get Audi to swap me out of the troublesome S4, which they refused, preferringto irritate me even more and actually having to pay me to buy the car back. Go figure.\n\nAnyway, he said he was starting at the dealer group\'s Porsche store next week. He wasnted to know what I was driving (didn\'t denegrate his Caddy competition saying he thought the CTS was a good looking car). Last day at Audi is today. Starts at Porsche on Monday.\n\nI told him of my test drive of the S3 and that I found it way too stiff. He said he hears that a lot and blamed to high perforamnce summer tires. He said the dealership routinely swaps out the summer tires for high performance all weather tires, which makes a big difference on the ride.\n\nHe did have pics on his phone of a new S3 they have in stock that was gorgeous.....white metallic with black and grey leather interior. He said they just put all weather shoes on it and I should stop by for a test drive. He said he wanted to leave the Audi store on a bang.\n\nTold him I was still stinging from my last go round with Audi. He didn\'t minimize my feelings stating he totally understood.

But, with the invite, I did.\n\nDealership had a couple of people in it, but not busy by any stretch.\n\nSales Manager I spoke to was there. He came over, shook my hand. Told me he was working a deal but got the keys for the S3 and told me to take it for a spin. He asked if I wanted his used car manager to look at my CTS....NO!!!!!!!!!\n\nOnward...pretty car in the metallic white Still a bit cramped but felt a bit aierier than the IS350 I tests drove awhile ago. Ride is much better with the all seasons. Probably give up a little at the edges of handling, but the all season certainly would make the car more liveable on a day-to-day basis.\n\nSeats are good, but not as good as the TL's or the CTS's. Not off by much, though. They were actually better looking than the ones I had in my previous S4. But, my S4 seats didn't have soft leather inserts, either.\n\nFaster than my CTS by a good meadure, although the motor is still a 2.0 Turbo with more HP but less torque. Weight (less on the S3), gearing and the DSG trans are what I attribute that, too. But, the CTS is roomier. In truth, it felt about as fast as my S4.\n\nNice interior, as expected. Much less in the way of controls, especially on the console vs my S4. Not sure one is better than the other, just different. This one had the handwriting recognition. In my brief time with it, it was hit and miss. LCD Pollping up out of the dash is way cooler than the tacked on screen with Benz or BMW. I'm used to my CTS's interface and have mastered it. I have familiarity with the Audi MMI. Not much has changed from what I remember.\n\nHandled well, rear danced a tad over some bumps, but it wasn't too bad. Never felt that in my S4, TL nor my CTS. LIke the CTS, lots of torque low. I like that. Not much is going to blow by you in the S3.\n\nSteering was direct. I liked the steering wheel a lot, but I liked the one in the S4 a lot, too.\n\nB&O stereo still trails the ELS in the TL and the (believe it or not) uplevel Bose in the CTS.\n\nStickered for nearly $49K. After a nice 30 minute run, I went back to the dealership, with only one customer taking delivery of an A6. SM asked how I liked it. I told him that for the money, I'd choose it over a 335i or C300. First, that kind of sticker will barely touch either of those cars. And, the S3 will outperform both.\n\nHe said he'd entice me by offering 5% off MSRP. Not in the market, and he knew I had an aversion to Audi.\n\nBut, if I still liked Audi, and I was in the market, that would be a helluva car for the money.""","b""Bradd...you know, I should have looked at the brand and model of tires, but didn't.

b'April 2015',b'nyccarguy',"b'@graphicguy - nice write up. I sat in an S3 at the ny auto show last week and definitely liked it a lot. Just those seats & steering wheel (same with the VW Golf R) alone was enough for me to stroke my chin and start thinking... I also like the fact that one can go light on the options & have a car that stickers in the low - mid $40K range. I also like that the screen pops in and out. I can\'t stand the ""iPad glued to the dashboard look.""

b'April 2015',b'markcincinnati',"b'Personal preference to be sure: the current Audi (and others) interior theme uses a pop-up screen that comes out of the dash and goes vertical when the car is started. The screen contains information I would consider to be desired at all times, so the screen is always up.\n\nYears ago, Pioneer offered an after-market head unit that had a similar pop-up screen. My 2005, 2009 and 2014 Audis all have the screens integrated into a sweeping clean looking dash -- no clutter, no pop up screen that looks like something from a SEMA show.\n\nIn short, those pop-up screens look, to me, to be aftermarket, not well integrated and, indeed, somewhat fragile.\n\nThey are ALMOST a deal breaker. The prev gen Cadillac CTS (2012 for instance) had a much better pop-up in terms of integration.\n\nMy prediction, the pop up screens are going to go away (at least in Audis) within a year or two. Probably just the time I\'ll be back in the market, hoping that there is a new B9 S4.\n\nDealer noted to me yesterday: ""The A6 now has the S4 engine; and the S3 has equal to or better than acceleration numbers than the S4. . ."" ""Audi will not let this stand, if history is any guide -- the new S4 will bump both HP and Torque to improve performance over the S3 and to show better numbers vs the A6.""\n\nStay tuned.\n\nThe S3 has a ride that, to me, takes firm into the realm of harsh.\n\nOf course one man\'s harsh is another man\'s firm -- perhaps that\'s what Audi Drive Select can address.'","b'show previous quotes\n\n\nThat\'s a devastating statement from somebody who had been a fan and have spent high tens of thousands this often.

b'April 2015',b'markcincinnati',"b'The best seats I have ever had are in my current 2014 Audi S4; my wife\'s SQ5 seats are about 99% as good as my S4\'s, too -- before that, I enjoyed excellent seats in:\n\n2009 A4 2.0T w/sport package\n2005 A6 with optional sport seats\n2005 X3 with optional sports seats\n2001 A6 4.2 with optional sport seats\n2000 A6 4.2 with optional sport seats\n1997 A8 with sport seats and about a million adjustments\n1996 S6 with the standard leather sport seats of the day\n1986 5000S quattro with the optional sport seats (in wool)\n\nWe also had a 1988 325ix BMW with the optional sport package, which, oddly, did not include sport suspension, but everything else was sported up, including the front chairs (which were great) and the super nice steering wheel -- which could not be heated when you got the sport package?!?\n\nCurrently, an A6 can be sort of had with sport seats, but, as I noted previously they are called Individual Contour Seats -- they seem to be a cross between the standard A6 seats and my S4 seats, plus massage and ventilation -- but the bolsters are not quite as prominent as in the S4.\n\nI\'m with those of you who consider the seats a deal breaker if they aren\'t what I want.\n\nMost of the above cars that had sport seats that were optional came with a maximum price of $1,000 and a normal price of $500 -- even adjusted for inflation, I can\'t figure out why not offer the options that people want -- IF YOU ALREADY market them in other geographies.\n\nI wondered for years what the big deal was about NOT offering heated REAR seats -- the cost of the seat warmers is probably quite low and a $250 - $500 up charge seems like a no-brainer. Finally, with respect to Audi at least, heated rear seats are at least offered for an extra charge.\n\nI signed onto the Audi Exclusive web page, and there are many optional choices for interior treatments that can be had -- yet, it is clear it is very difficult to order sportier seats via that exclusive program if they are not normally offered in your market. The Audi Exclusive program seems more like a decorating option than a functional one -- not that that is a bad thing.\n\nWhile I am ranting, I really don\'t get why so many things are bundled together into one mid-four-figure ""package"" -- if all I want is a top-view camera, it appears I have to take automatic cruise control, w/stop and start, lane keeping assistance and pre-sense plus. Now, I\'d gladly buy top view and pre-sense plus, but paying for lane assist and cruise control with full-stop, start capabilities does not, today at least, interest me.\n\nMy belief is that folks do things based on what is marketed to them within certain cost parms.\n\nI am not keen on paying for a seat massage function, when all I am after is bolstered chairs in the first place, so, I am likely to pass on the expensive option, and, without that option, I am likely to pass on the car and HOPE that the next gen A4 line will amp up both the L and the P.\n\nI hope and pray that the explanation for all this bundling isn\'t to reduce the cost of certifying the cars for sale in the US -- stranger things, I imagine, though.'",b''

The word I honed in on was ""further,"" which would assume they had been previously humbled.\n\nIt would seem that everyone here appears to have an opinion that, to me, reads something like (speaking of the Germans): The way fill-in-the-blank"" (usually filled in with BMW) cars were during the fill-in-the-blank (usually some year or range of years that is at least 5 years ago, often as much as 15) is better than they are today. The author of said opinion/perspective will usually attribute their reasons for stating the ""fact"" of better then than now, to be the current difficulty in getting today\'s version with a stick shift or the increase in luxury content at the expense of performance, the selection by the manufacturer of run flat tires or whatever other dislike is currently popular.\n\nFar as I can tell, however, the German auto makers Audi, BMW and Mercedes (and probably Porsche, but not as often mentioned) were not humbled THEN and therefore are highly unlikely to have been ""further"" humbled by Acura, Lexus and Infiniti.\n\nCurrent auto review magazine\'s still typically pick a European over an Asian, and more to the point, typically pick a German over a Japanese. When there is a ""comparo"" report between the Japanese ELLPS or LPS and the offering from Germany (in the same class), the German\'s usually finish ahead of their Japanese rival (the one glaring example to the contrary is when the Lexus IS bested the BMW 3, and that was over a year ago).\n\nGenerally, the German examples rule the category -- far as I can tell if there is any humbling, it is the exception rather than the rule.\n\nI so wanted to love the Q50 Infiniti (at the time I was in a 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD) and did end up ordering a IS 350 with the F-sport package when I thought I would be forced to ""settle"" for a Lexus to replace the Acura, thinking, at the time, an Audi will be too expensive to be considered, compared to the IS 350. I was mistaken -- an S4 was ""within reach.""\n\nThe point or better said, question, is, when were the Germans in humble mode and when were they further humbled by Lexus and Infiniti, to quote laurasdada\'s previous post?\n\nDriving it like I live . . .'",b''

b'April 2015',b'markcincinnati',"b'dino - I guess I should add, too, that I don\'t actually know that the Japanese LPS brands have previously been humbled, either -- but I think (my opinion) they have, or at least they should be since they so frequently are NOT the winner in comparos in the BIG, IMPORTANT car magazines.\n\nI saw MotorWeek on TV this week and the Lexus GS was tested (not compared), things went along nicely as the car was shown on the track and street -- and then WHAM! John Davis pretty much put the car in its place (which was to say, it was NOT at the top of the Premium car heap, based on comments about handling, braking, etc),\n\nYet, ""everyone"" I know who has a Lexus loves them -- of course whenever I ask why, the reason, THE reason, THE #1 REASON, the ONLY reason I can ever get out of them, is either how reliable or durable they are.\n\nOdd, methinks, how I can\'t ever seem to elicit a comment about a Lexus, Infiniti or Acura that praises their performance, style, switchgear -- oh oh oh, I take it back, once, someone told me how good the sound system in his Acura is (and speaking as a previous Acura TL SH-AWD Advance owner, I agree -- Acura has the best sound systems for mere mortals -- the only one that is better is the hyper expensive B&O option Audi offers for $6,000+).\n\nDon\'t get me wrong, a sound system is very important in a car -- but, you know, when someone tells me about their 5 series or their new Mercedes E or C, they tell me about the performance, ergonomics, 8-speed or 7-speed transmission, engine, responsiveness, cornering, etc, etc, etc.\n\nMy wife thinks that her Infiniti was great -- from a durability (and probably reliability) standpoint.

b'April 2015',b'dino001',"b'To me Lexus has been traditionally perfect car for people who don\'t care about cars (don\'t get excited about them, don\'t want to know anything about how throttle or gears work, don\'t watch any motor sports, etc.), but need a car and want one that is going to be comfortable, well designed, high quality today and five years from now, reliable, low maintenance and yet tell everybody they have both money and taste. BTW, I remember one guy stating repeating couple of times low depreciation as a primary reason he got a Lexus. I have always bought a car for myself, not the next guy, but I understand his thinking - if all he wanted was to minimize the cost and maximize the content, Lexus was just perfect for him. Just like Toyota is perfect for the same kind of people with less money. BTW, this is probably 80% of the population, if not more.\n\nI\'m not looking down on those people, not at all - they have their busy lives, they don\'t need or want to know anything about weight distribution, cornering ability. I\'m sure they have other passions that I could not care less about.\n\nHowever, over time, Lexus noticed that they left that over 20% of those with means to buy their cars wouldn\'t even give them time of the day - so they change their product (a little) and advertising (a lot - most of their ads are about ""F"" lines even if they actually sell small fraction of those). BMW did the opposite - they have owned those 20% for decades - the 80% majority would stay away, unless the lease payment was right and even after then they would constantly complain about small back seat and ""harsh"" suspension, or road noise, tire wear, or all those things we know sporty cars do (including higher maintenance). So in order to grow, BMW changed their product (unlike Lexus, they changed it a lot). They don\'t really miss that 20%, because those guys still have nowhere else to go and all they can do is grumble.

To a large extent the 1st legend and Infiniti were it along with the 3 series.\nWhatever humbling happened to Audi it certainly was not at Acura\'s hand if that is what your comment suggests -- Audi was humbled because they were first maligned by a 60 Minutes story that made the preposterous claim that an Audi 5000\'s 5-cylinder engine could overpower its brakes (which it couldn\'t); then it was hobbled by its own hand because it was so ARROGANT it its response to the 60 Minutes piece (which Audi knew was false but didn\'t have the ability to see was the PERCEPTION the Minutes piece left the viewers with) that they said, American drivers are so ham-footed that they can\'t press the right pedal (or, the lie, that if you pressed both the accelerator and brake pedal of an Audi the engine was sooo powerful it would make the car lurch forward).\n\nSo, yes, Audi was humbled [perhaps] -- but NOT by Acura, Audi was humbled by Audi. Their reaction to the fake news of the day was what nearly done \'em in.\n\nThe Lexus LS may have -- in hindsight -- captured the buying public\'s eye for a ""cheaper"" and ""similar"" [to a Mercedes S, well, sorta] car -- today a top o\' the line Lexus attracts shoppers for the reasons I noted, then, well, no one knew they were going to be so durable, but they were cheaper (but the Hyundai Equus is cheaper than an LS is today, too, though). Then, I don\'t recall that Lexus actually took too much out of Mercedes pockets. The only country Lexus was sold in was the US (OK, North America). Even today, a company like Audi sells 175,000 cars in the US (out of total sales of over 1.2M). So while we\'re important for the image (which is huge), we\'re not so much important in revenue -- and then, well, most folks couldn\'t even spell globalization.\n\nI would think the Germans and the Japanese alike are always looking at the market, their direct competition, their indirect competition and what is looming on the horizon that could be trouble.\n\nI assume they\'re all a bit concerned (too strong a word?) by the product coming out of Korea -- and even the American manufacturers are no longer to be ignored.\n\nSo, my retort is pretty much that Audi, not Acura was the cause of the dark days (with an honorable mention at least to the inaccurate 60 Minutes story Unintended Acceleration) for that brand -- and far as I can tell Audi\'s behavior could hardly have been more opposite to humble if it tried even harder.\n\nMercedes, even when they were somehow supposedly threatened by Lexus wasn\'t really put out much by the product, as much as they were put out by the hype -- and even so, the US (at that time) was still a pretty small peanut insofar as sales+image were concerned, compared with the rest of the planet\'s uptake of Mercs.\n\nAnd, while I pretty much agree about BMW\'s -- a 1980\'s era BMW was still a bit of a rarity and were known for being ""breathtakingly expensive"" to maintain and god help you if you needed to repair one or take one to a body shop.\n\nThe folks I knew who knew or thought they knew about cars (remember I\'m old enough to have been alive then) in the early \'80\'s often would equate BMW\'s and Porsche\'s -- and some folks even had the gall (or ignorance) to tell me that BMW stood for British Motor Works.\n\nI\'m still of the mind that if anyone is doing any humbling, it\'s the Germans who be the ""humble -ers,"" not the ""humble -ees.""\n\nCheck out the new Car and Driver comparo (spoiler alert, the ""long in the tooth"" S5 kicks butt and takes names AGAIN! -- wonder how the Lexus fares?

If I would have spent somewhere between $10 and $15K less on a TL-SH-AWD from my S4, I would have done so to save the money, get a better sound system, and perhaps enjoy legendary Acura reliability hassle free low cost maintenance ownership.\n\nUltimately I decided on the S4 because it looked better inside and out (style), drove faster, quicker, class leading transmission system, handled better/sharper/faster, the brakes felt better, the Quattro seemed superior to SH-AWD (less of a FWD with AWD on-demand type thing like Acura), and I could get it with contrasting Napa Leather interior (chose the Magma Red; beautiful). Also, I could choose Misano Red exterior whereas with Acura you have to settle with a purple looking red.\n\nLastly, I know the S4 is very easily tune-able, as I\'m now driving an S4 that is as fast as an RS4 at 395-to 405 HP with just a simple REVO flash software tune. Your power varies based on the quality of gas and conditions like temperature. Get 93 or 100 octane gas and you can easily get to 410-415 HP. I do feel the difference. It is as if the car is doing what it was always meant to do now, performing the way the engine can perform without restrictions, limiters, & regulations being in its way! Without making concessions to the EPA, emissions, nannies, fuel economy, and insurance company charge rates (I think this is why Audi under rates the power in its cars), the S4 is a BEAST. I think 400 HP is a new magical number. Of course, 300 HP would suffice if the car was 500+ lbs. less.\n\nGranted, if you don\'t have a heavy right foot, you can still keep the EPA happy with your gas mileage.

Since the MSRP\'s (from a practical standpoint) are all over the board, we need to think, for example, 3 series, not 3 series until they exceed $40 or $45K.\n\nThose who lease (apparently the majority) shop mo pay, not MSRP. And those who do buy, well, of course they\'re welcome too.

My wife will not have a car without AWD here in Colorado even though we really only ""need"" it about 10-15 days per year. \n\nHere\'s ""a"" thing -- not the thing, a thing: The list of BRANDs we discuss here (and elsewhere) that do not offer AWD versions of their models has diminished to an incredibly small number. Perception is reality is the phrase we live by, even if we don\'t always agree. The perception is that the higher performing models from Audi, BMW and Mercedes (just to name the Germans for an example) now offer AWD virtually if not literally and I think we\'re closing in on literally, across their entire lines. Porsche, clearly not an LPS generally speaking, has 20 different cars for sale all called 911\'s -- I believe they are all offered with AWD. And, often the ones (of any ilk, brand or type) that achieve the most ""wins"" are the AWD models.\n\nBut, even if that were not true -- what really matters is what people buy. Pull into a parking lot of a high zoot country club and look at the trunk emblems on the carefully parked high buck LPS (or, of you ike ELLPS) cars -- the majority of them will be xdrive, CTS or ATS4\'s, or quattros or four-matics or AWD badged in some way.\n\nLet\'s assume that my wife and your wife, knowing that they can only actually REQUIRE AWD for about 2-5 days per year (for go power in snow); and that they could probably go if they would use winter tires with FWD or RWD, just fine, were asked if they would give up AWD. I am positive the answer from my wife would be, ""don\'t take away my AWD.""\n\nThe perception and the sales have been pointing to AWD, automatic transmissions, not naturally aspirated engines, more than 6 speeds in the transmission (or at the very least, nothing less than 6 speeds) and more and more electronic driving aids.\n\nEntry level may have started off as meaning ""cheaper versions"" of higher line cars from a given mfg. And, as a practical matter, at base, no options, that is, MSRP, that is still true. But I am today convinced (by virtue of what the dealer folks tell me) that the only reason for a given BASE MSRP is the tv commercial and the lease price. And, even that is changing -- now the tv ads tout the car that is being advertised for $X pre month is ""nicely equipped"" -- if you hit the pause button and read the fine print, the cars being advertised are more and more likely to no longer be base models. Unless mandated to do so, you would be hard pressed to even find a base price model at a dealership.\n\nThe reason is no one will buy one of this class of car NEW at least without the ""premium"" package on it, so dealers stock their lots -- since most Americans won\'t orders cars, cause they have to have it today -- with cars that are popularly equipped. This translates to a lot, but not all, of the options on the check sheet.\n\nI spoke to a German dealer rep who thought we (Americans) were crazy for ""always"" putting sunroofs in our cars since those of us who have them rarely, if ever, open them. Big bucks for a vestigial options. It is virtually impossible to get a German car sans sunroof -- and if you try, well you for sure throw yourself into a class of car that the leasing organizations will not sub-vent, because they have the experience with a market that won\'t buy a car that doesn\'t have a sunroof, even if no one ever opens them.\n\nThe point of all of this is to say, OK, I\'ll concede the historical meaning of ELLPS meant ""low cost"" -- but what is now ELLPS, then would have to be A3\'s, but NOT A4\'s (the B9\'s will certainly cost more than the B8\'s, even at base, strippie levels.) Then we need somewhere to put the A4\'s, 3 series and C class\'s -- to say nothing of some of the other ""premium"" offerings from Asia and America.\n\nIf you agree about the use of the term Entry Level as not necessarily being about $, the M3, for instance is the Entry Level M car -- and, at this point in time, there is no Entry Level RS car, unless you accept that Audi has chosen for whatever reason to only offer an RS4 as a ""station wagon"" -- and one, even at that, that cannot be had in the US.\n\nWe can go on about our business, and as long as we do not violate the terms of use of the Edmunds organization, who cares if we agree or disagree or agree to disagree about size or base MSRP.\n\nI\'m interested in speaking with, in print, folks who love (or at least like) luxury performance sedans -- and, here, luxury performance sedans that are compacts -- thus ruling out their big brothers and sisters, the 5\'s, E\'s, etc.\n\nEven then, if someone is shopping for a 5 and goes with a 3 or a 7, I would find their thoughts and comments of interest.\n\nIf LPS is supposed to include ""I wish I was an LPS car"" type of vehicle, I\'m not interested so much.\n\nI think the VW CC or Passat are good cars -- interesting cars, perhaps even desirable cars, but today I don\'t think they are members of the LPS club. But they certainly are priced lower, for the most part. It\'s just they aren\'t LPS class cars. If we\'re looking to discuss them, we all know where to go.\n\nThe reason for the A3 and CLA (for example)? According to the two dealers I spoke with, the reason for these new, less expensive models is that the ELLPS variants typically sell for a number beginning with either a high four number or a low five number -- these new models allow folks who want to be in the Mercedes family to join for $37,500 rather than $57,500 -- and hopefully will trade UP next time.\n\nI believe Mercedes is just following the Alfred P Sloan model -- start them out with a Chevy and hopefully they\'ll eventually buy a Cadillac. Start them out with a CLA and maybe someday they\'ll be back for an S Class.\n\nIt could work.\n\nI think entry level is a name that needs some rethinking. The lower cost of the ELLPS vs the LPS is, apparently, a function of the wheelbase, length overall and width of the model -- back to the EPA classification, if you will.'",b'show previous quotes'
b'March 2015',b'm6user',"b'""these new models allow folks who want to be in the Mercedes family to join for $37,500 rather than $57,500 -- and hopefully will trade UP next time.""\n\nThat\'s exactly what an ""entry"" level car is. ELLPS is the lowest price performance sedan of a given maker. If a car qualifies all the alphas then it should be included. I don\'t personally see the CLA, ILX and 320 for examples as performance sedans even though they are entry level luxury.'",b''
b'March 2015',b'graphicguy',"b'All good points. The starting numbers, for all cars, are now in the high teens. Those prices are populated by the Fiat 500, Kia Soul, Hyundai Accent, Cruise, Fiesta, etc. Most, if not all, sacrifice one or the other portions or power, refinement, quality of materials, material quality, etc. Sometimes sacrificing a lot of everything. That\'s how they get to those price points.\n\nSome manufacutrer have become quite clever. They\'ll wrap their ""cheap"" cars in innovative styles. Look close enough, and it\'s hard to mask the underlying cost cutting.\n\nWhen you move up that ladder, into the Civics or Accords, Corollas or Camry, Fusion, Malibu, Mazda 3 or 6, etc., you crack that $25K price, with the best of them hitting the low $30s.\n\nFrom my perception, that\'s where the A3, CLA, 320i, ILX, probably a 2.5L ATS want to play (I suppose you can throw the Infiniti G in there, but that\'s pretty old these days). Not the best those brands can do, but it gets you in the door of the brand. 3 year lease is over, You think, I\'m making a little more money, and boy was that C Class ever sexy looking when I was last in the showroom and hopefully, if you had a good experience with the previous car, you\'re driving off in a $45K C Class, or A4, or 328, loaded up TLX, or an ATS with the better drivetrain, with more options.\n\nAll of a sudden, all those promises of having a good portfolio and compound interest are starting to bear fruit. Now, you\'re in the $50K-$60K bracket. Now, you\'re looking at E Class, A6, CTS. You wouldn\'t dream of sullying your driveway with an Impala (even though it\'s every bit as good as an XTS).\n\nMark, you\'re right. That\'s what Sloan started, and the hope for all these brands, how they want to ""hook"" you from the start.\n\nWhere Mercedes and BMW seem to have an advantage, they\'ve positioned themselves as aspirational brands. Cadillac used to be there. I think some of that is still there. Their missteps have cost them some of that, though. I\'ve not driven an A3. But, I have driven an S3. Fun car. To live with it everyday? Probably wouldn\'t be my choice. Test drove a CLA. That is not a good car. An Accord is better in every way. But, you have a Mercedes, an aspirational brand. And, you\'re in it for about the price of a loaded Accord.\n\nI\'ll accept that the 320i is a good car based in FN\'s reports. But, I\'ve only driven one when my sister was shopping them (she ended up with a C Class.......BECAUSE IT WAS A MERCEDES...320i was the better car, IMHO). Audi wasn\'t on her radar based on my experience with them.\n\nAudi and Acura are FWD architectures. Today, these platforms are SO GOOD, it really doesn\'t matter to me. I know for many of you, it does. The Mercedes, Cadillac (ATS/CTS) are RWD platforms. But, Mercedes is bringing their FWD platform here, too.\n\nWhat does any of this have to do with ELLPS? Probably not diddly....except everyone in here will be in the Audi, Acura, Cadillac, BMW, Mercedes showrooms sometime in the next 24 months....guaranteed.'",b''

Since the MSRP's (from a practical standpoint) are all over the board, we need to think, for example, 3 series, not 3 series until they exceed $40 or $45K.\n\nThose who lease (apparently the majority) shop mo pay, not MSRP. And those who do buy, well, of course they're welcome too.

If the vehicle performs well and has luxury, the wheels driven are a design issue. It is the performance that counts and there are quite a few vehicles that are fwd that still have good performance - some of them even have better steering feel than the current BMW 3 series which to me is a more important indicator of a sporty vehicle. I\'m not usually cornering at .9gs or doing donuts in parking lots, so the driven wheels don\'t matter to me so much.\n\nAs far as entry level, I\'d agree with previous posts - it should not be the brand, or the size, it should be *luxury* and *performance*, regardless of those other factors. You could argue that the ILX doesn\'t have enough luxury and/or performance, and if that is the case (not necessarily agreeing with that; only for argument), then it is the TLX which is the ""ELLPS"" for Acura since it\'s got a low enough price with the requisite amount of luxury and performance.

The characteristics of these that stands out first is size -- and as the cars get larger, in the progression the price does indeed escalate. But, prior to the current A3, the Audi A4/A5/S4/S5/RS5 were the ""entry level"" cars in the line. They were of a common, more or less, wheelbase length and the other notable characteristics that shared the theme were length and width -- size.\n\nThe part that conveys the cost factor is the amount of the content of Land P and a ""certain something"" that somehow we all understand, but like the word ""quality"" is a bit more difficult to define. A Chevy with a 110"" wheelbase is not a member of the ELLPS club. A BMW 3 series, no matter how tarted up or down, however, is.\n\nIf the bothersome two letters are EL, well that is beyond our capabilities to modify. These are smaller LPS cars, and generally they cost less than their LPS counter parts. That, I think, is why a strippie 3 and a fully loaded 335 are both ELLPS cars.\nI used to say that the cheapest model of a brand is all that counted, but I\'m thinking differently on that now. I think as long as it hits the pricepoint, it counts. So if that includes more than 1 model from a manufacturer, so be it. Reason being that not all manufacturers have more than 1 model. So just because Volvo doesn\'t have something smaller than the S60 at the moment, that shouldn\'t put the others at a disadvantage because they can only put their subcompacts up against it. I also think the price, if positioned properly, excludes the true mid-sizers such as the CTS, 5-series, E-class, and A6.'",b''
b'March 2015',b'markcincinnati',"b'If pricepoint, not size + L+P, is the determining factor for inclusion in this class or nomenclature, can we safely assume that the base price of the base model is ""whatever it is"" and that all modifications to that price based on ""options and packages"" are included in the mix? This, then, means we still have to have some way to account for the ""L"" and ""P"" of the cars (and of course the L+P add both content and cost, even to the base).\n\nPerhaps we can then say that a base 3 series and a fully-optioned 335 are both ELLPS cars because they both start out at a price point of $X.\n\nMy car, today, is at the Audi dealer for its 25,000 service interval. Since the dealer has a policy of ""trying"" to match the loaner they provide with the car in for service, I was provided with an S4 for the day. The thing has 1,800 miles on it and is Misano Red Pearl in color (this color is a $500 option); the car also has the B&O sound system upgrade and blind spot monitoring. As a loaner, it also happens to be one equipped with the S-tronic (dual clutch) automatic transmission.\n\nI consider this car below what I would think almost anyone, today, would go for -- but the dealer general manager says no, this car is EXACTLY the base model from a practical perspective, because ""they can\'t sell"" a version without some level of equipment above ""book"" entry level (what I would call a true stippie).\n\nIndeed, since the car does not have MMI, it will probably only sell because it will -- eventually -- come out of the loaner fleet and be subject to very heavy off MSRP discounting. The ""on the lot"" cars virtually all have MMI+, those that don\'t were probably ordered specifically without nav with the dealer knowing they would end up in the loaner fleet.\n\nYou may or may not chafe at the nearly $3,500 price tag for the MMI+ system, but the take up of that option is, apparently, nearly universal, as is S-Tronic. Yet, sitting on the showroom floor there are a couple of A4\'s (and one of them, too, is nav-less); I would argue that the base price of these Junior-LPS cars is rarely seen by the actual buyers, since most folks do, typically, go for the ""popular"" option group.\n\nI must note, too, that one reason for the majority going with the popular option groups and/or packages is that the lease calculations FAVOR the high-content variants over the maxed out variants and the strippie variants. Some car-actuary has figured out what will retain the highest residual -- and that, these days, is medium to medium high loaded.\n\nSo, if price, not size, is to be the rule of the day, I would have to submit that the price range of cars that fit the bill of ELLPS must be on the order of $39,999 to $69,999; after all it is possible to start out with a BMW 328 ""Walmart"" (or TJ Max) version and max out at a 335ix ""Bespoke"" (so to speak) and spend tens of thousands crossing the chasm from pauper to prince.'","b""Whatever it maxes out to should be largely irrelevant since different people want different options. I'm thinking either $40k or $45k as the max base price."""

Otherwise, you open the door to comparison of a CTS Vsport to a base 320i, for example, as 2 ELLPS cars. Whatever it maxes out to should be largely irrelevant since different people want different options. I\'m thinking either $40k or $45k as the max base price. The $45k would allow for the 335i and V6 ATS, but it would allow in the S3. The $40k would exclude the S3 but also limit the group to the 4-cyl models of the aforementioned compacts. Either pricepoint excludes the mid-sizers.

Some additional differentiations by unique colors, interior versions, or other aesthetic treatments will separate those trims further.\n\nThen M3/4 and RS4/5 with (future C AMG) could be called ""high performance compact luxury sports sedans"". ATS-V, if finally released, will surely be aspiring to that club. This segment will mean not only separate special engines, but special solutions related to suspension, weight reduction, chassis design modifications made specifically to support the performance.

I used to frequent this forum ages ago, but just haven\'t found my way over here for awhile.\n\nNice discussion on BMWs - old and new.\n\nAs many of you know from the CCBA forum, I\'ve had 3 5-series (and 5 3-series - isn\'t that funny? ) - an E39, an E60 and most recently, an F30. The E39 and E60 were manual transmissions - a 2002 530i sport and a 2007 530xi. Loved both - still miss and regret a bit giving up the E39.

I certainly wasn\'t expecting anything like the E39. I loved the styling (particularly with the M-sport package), the pull of the engine (535i) and the comfortable and luxurious ride. In the relatively short time I had it, I appreciated those attributes for my long commute.\n\nBut, alas, my yearning for something with more feel to it (not to mention the manual transmission), won out and I bought my Mazda3 a couple weeks ago.\n\nThe look on my friends and co-workers\' faces when I say I traded in my BMW for the Mazda is priceless. They\'re used to me trading out cars on a regular basis, but this switch just has them speechless.

I decided to start with Piero Taruffi's The Technique of Motor Racing. It was first published in 1959, but the basics of high performance driving(and the laws of physics) remain constant. It's not for everyone- Taruffi uses lots of equations and diagrams to illustrate basic and advanced driving principles. On the lighter side, the vintage pictures of F1 and sports car races at various tracks are entertaining as well. And as far as driver safety goes, things have moved on a bit, as there is some discussion of leather helmets as well as the pros and cons of wearing seat belts in an open car.

Generally, ""like"" vehicle does exactly mean size and arguably some comfort feature content, one could also argue for safety, but that\'s about it. The other party liability should do reasonable effort to allow you maintaining your lifestyle without much disruption, so if your lifestyle includes some leisure activities requiring driving, then they should in theory compensate for that, but I doubt any jury or court would be too sympathetic for weekend going 100+ mph somewhere. Moreover, are you really insured for going on track in your own contract? I\'d check that, if I were you - if you hit something or somebody during such an event, you may be unpleasantly surprised by exclusion on your own insurance contract. So, if you are not even insured for that under your own contract, I can see the liable party easily weasel out of their obligation, at least their insurance.

I did the same thing on one trip to Zurich. I kept noticing no inventory -- but sometimes quite a showroom.\n\nOne trip, I went to the new Audi dealership that is at the Munich airport -- I asked the rep why no inventory? He told me that almost all of the cars they sell are ordered. Almost every Audi (and BMW) that we\'ve had since 1978 have been special order cars. I always thought if you\'re going to spend ($50K+ in today\'s $s) and will settle for your third color option and not getting the options you wanted, etc, there must be something wrong with your sense of money. Why pay that much for a car that you wouldn\'t ever special order, but you\'ll take it because you can pick it up on Monday?\n\nThe 10th (so they say) largest BMW dealer is here in Cincinnait. We have two Audi dealerships, two BMW, three Mercedes, two Porsche, etc etc, stores in our Big Town (almost a small city). I have, many times, attempted to find THE car I wanted in stock -- ""can\'t be done!"" My most recent Audi was $57+K and my wife\'s SQ5 was $65+K. At what level of income does one have to achieve in order to settle for a $60K car that is ""sitting on the lot?""\n\nI wanted blind spot monitoring and red leather. I also wanted all-season OEM tires. My wife also wanted blind spot and red leather -- but she wanted metallic black, while I wanted white. I would\'ve probably taken the metallic white Audi offers, but I was very specific in what I wanted as was she.\n\nWhat I can\'t imagine is being willing to settle on in-stock inventory, unless the exact vehicle was available or unless the price was hugely discounted. I took my 2012 Acura TL with a black leather interior -- a color I said I would never have (it makes the inside of the car feel small, to me at least, plus it is hotter than hell in the summer and the black seats often fade and look cheap) -- because the price was steeply discounted. What was I thinking? That fugly interior may have contributed to my relatively short time with the thing.\n\nSo, here is the other ""benefit"" of ordering your car: it kind of feels like you get ""the new car joy"" twice, once when you order it and once a couple of months later when it comes in.\n\nOrdered cars, too, generally cost less than ones from inventory. The reason? The dealer doesn\'t have to pay the interest on the cars while they sit in inventory -- the dealer has a customer the moment the car comes in. Floorplan costs for your ordered car are likely to be very low.\n\nWhen I see one of those mega dealerships with a 150 car showroom and a huge (acres) lot -- one so big you have to be shuttled to the location of the car you\'re going to look at -- I assume someone has to pay for that, and I assume it will be the customers.\n\nThe tiny dealer can order the same car as the big guy -- so if you\'re looking for the best deal, well the dealer that is so big the TV commercials have to be shot from a helicopter, is the one to avoid. Sometimes, Small really is Beautiful.'","b""I was talking to our CA yesterday he was informing me that BMW has not released their ED allocation yet for the 2016 MY (something I already knew.)

Rick does not want Black interior living here in the SW that is the last color one wants to have.\n\nWhat I find interesting is, the CA say's, the GM orders the cars based on what people buy, this makes sense, however, I told him if the GM only orders cars with black interior and people purchase what is in stock does that really mean that black interior is what they want? Most of the 3 series they have in stock has, black interior, I would beat that many who purchase 2 and 3 series do not know they can order their cars and of course the CA's are going to say anything about as they do not make money until the car is delivered.\n\nNow on a side note, my CA informed that BMW has raised the residual on the 5 series from 60% to 64% on all 5 series excluding M5's, So this means you can get into a 5 series for less then $500/m on a 36 month lease."""

It was without a doubt the best driving car I have ever owned - smooth, sharp, and shifted like butter. But I got rid of it earlier than any other car I have ever owned - at 88K miles.

b'March 2015',b'roadburner',"b'markcincinnati- Mmy opinions pretty much align with this article, which essentially anoints the M235i as the true successor to the E46 M3- although I\'m more than ""slightly annoyed that it\xe2\x80\x99s not used on a broader range of the company\xe2\x80\x99s products."" It\'s shrewd but cynical marketing on Munich\'s part, forcing enthusiasts to pay considerably more to get a car with traditional BMW driving characteristics. Even European drivers are unsure of which end their 1er is driven, so I suppose BMW figures why bother offering a better driving experience.\n\nAnother problem is that the competition has become much more intense as the playing field has leveled. It used to be that great handling, supportive seats, decent brakes, and an engaging powertrain were the exclusive province of the Europeans, but not any more.\n\nFor example, If I wanted an AWD performance car a BMW wouldn\'t be on my radar- a Golf R would be my likely choice, at least until the Focus RS arrives or Mazda offers their rumored AWD 300 hp MS3. While the M235i would be my choice if I wanted a great two door coupe, It\'s hard to ignore the S5, Mustang GT or 370Z NISMO which bracket the 2er at both ends of its price range. To each his own, but after 35 years of continuous BMW ownership I no longer many vehicles in their product line to be even remotely desirable...'",b''

b'March 2015',b'markcincinnati',"b'I don\'t know how it happened, but my wife\'s interest in cars these days seems to focus on horsepower and torque, all-wheel-drive, safety, handling capability (even if hardly ever tapped), some bells and whistles (but she thinks cruise control is the devil\'s own feature, refuses to use it) -- like blind spot monitoring, sat nav and voice commands for the phone and nav -- and, big wheels and tires (she has to have 20"" wheels and very wide, low profile Ultra High Performance All-Seasons).\n\nSure, she wants good gas mileage and a reliable and durable car -- all wrapped up in a vehicle that meets her definition of ""soul."" Her SQ5 (and, truth be told, probably a Porsche Macan) dots all the ""i\'s"" etc. Her Infiniti FX35 -- a car that I thought was very capable, even though it lacked a 354HP supercharged engine -- was very well built, was reliable for nearly 60,000 miles (so I can\'t speak to its durability) and despite its thrashy engine note, was pretty much fun to drive (if you could stand 16MPGs). Yet, her Infiniti and my Acura TL pretty much made her run, not walk to the Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Mercedes, Porsche, Volvo and VW dealers to find a CUV -- a high performance CUV. The 300HP X3 was good, the Volvo XC60 Type-R was good, too, the Mercedes M class, VW Toureg and Cadillac SRX all had merit. We even tried the top o\' the line Jeep Grand both with and without the Hemi. The MDX and RDX were also tested and quickly rejected.\n\nWhen we got to the 3,0T Audi Q5 there was a glimmer of hope -- and there we were torn between the Q5 and X3 -- until we test drove the SQ5. I\'ve never seen $21,000 (the down payment on the $65K MSRP) exit the checking account more quickly -- I think the second test drive of the SQ5 sealed the deal.\n\nYet, some here have spouses (or significant others) who are all about gas mileage or roominess for kids, dogs -- and all the stuff that goes along with kids and dogs.\n\nAnd, the good news is, we\'re all right -- the SQ5 is the best car, just as the MDX or the TLX or the 535 or the ATS or A4 quattro or even the lowly Accord -- all of these vehicles are the best for ""your"" circumstances and situations.\n\nWhen we get to the ELLPS and LPS class of cars, we are well beyond the basics -- we\'re into vehicles that are helping us in their own ways to self-actualize. That is what it is about -- finding the car that today will help you self-actualize. I\'d add, if your spending on a new car doesn\'t help you even in some tiny way to self-actualize, you\'ve NOT chosen wisely.\n\nOne of the car magazines (Automobile perhaps, hell, I dunno, I subscribe to all of them for pity\'s sake), has a phrase they use ""No Boring Cars."" I think as we enter one of the later decades of life, we do actually start to believe ""now is the time to eschew \'boring\' cars"" (and other things, but this is the place for cars, NOT for other things); we decide we can differentiate between an Impala and a CTS, we can appreciate a Panamera (even if we decide not to spend that much on a car).\n\nI\'ve really enjoyed reading all the posts here (well mostly), for example the ones about the upcoming trip to Germany to pick up the new BMW, the good the bad and the ugly S4 issues, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat, so to speak.\n\nI do enjoy the many perspectives y\'all bring to the party here. I love it when this forum is active -- even when time doesn\'t permit my participation.\n\nWe are, if you axe me, in the golden age of cars -- almost limitless choice and hardly a klinker in the bunch.\n\nI now have 23,000+ miles on my \'14 S4 -- today I lust for an S6, tomorrow I\'ll instead hope for a new, slightly larger S4 to be unveiled. All the while, I am impressed every time I get behind the wheel of my current car. Reading your posts about your adventures in car shopping (and some mis-adventures) is great fun, often informative and from time to time frustrating.\n\nSorry to get so sentimental, but this forum is really a terrific outlet for those of us car enthusiasts whose appetite is larger than our bank accounts. It also has been, for me at least, a fantastic catharsis.\n\nAs you were.'","b'Just received my latest issue of C & D, brief test of the new Jag XE.

I AM paying up (of course within limits of my abilities), I WILL NOT buy a car from a lot, just because it is a ""better deal"", if it doesn\'t hit my minimum requirements.

I correct them, of course and they then ask me why Audi puts the ""T"" on both the super and turbo charged cars.\n\nI give them the party line that is somewhat difficult to say with a straight face, we both shrug and I then tell them my S4 is both incredibly quick off the line and very fast thanks to the instantaneous response only a supercharged (or, granted, a naturally aspirated) engine can offer.\n\nEven the dweebs are excited at the Audi and BMW store is the point -- the folks [shoppers] at Infiniti of Cincinnati and Columbia Acura, well, they\'re more concerned with things like ""can I run it on regular?""\n\nMaybe I need to seek out a better class of dweebs.'","b'So the question is/stands: What can or will ""you"" (or the consumer) do?

Its seems doubtful that they\'ll ever catch up to the enthusiasm and popularity of the top makes, but I think there\'s a chance they could get closer. Just like for every other make, there are fan sites for Acura too, and some of the people there seem quite knowledgeable:\n\nhttp://acurazine.com/\n\nEven though Leonard Nimoy famously participated in an advertisement for Audi along with Zachary Quinto, which I imagine everyone here knows, in my mind Acura is the more ""logical and rational"" luxury brand. Perhaps for some Acura lacks passion at times, but as a long time Star Trek fan I somehow imagine that Mr. Spock might approve of some of their cars, as well as of their legendary reliability and longevity.

As you might imagine, being an Audi loudmouth for so many years, I do participate in my share of (apparently) Audi sponsored surveys.\n\nI was surprised to see the number of questions some of these surveys contain that clearly indicate the Germans (or maybe it is just Audi, I dunno) are concerned that some Korean mfgrs are ""breathing down their necks.""\n\nNow, I said that last bit for emphasis, but there has been at least a seed planted in the German mfgrs minds that says, ""The Koreans are Coming, The Koreans are Coming"" (and of course I immediately add -- mentally -- ""Cover yourself with butter and carry lemons just in case. . .!"")\n\nBut seriously, I saw some TV show on Velocity (I think) where a new Genesis (V8) was compared to a Mercedes E-Class and a Volvo S60. Now, at the time, before the video rolled, I thought, ""Whose dumbass idea was it to compare these three; they\'re not even close, no one would ever cross shop them?!""\n\nTurns out I was wrong -- the Genesis, although not exactly a great handling car, has had its suspension tuned by Lotus (sorta) and the thing had a very powerful and smooooooth V8 hooked up to an 8-speed transmission (plus it had all of the latest and greatest electronic safety aids and toys the Germans keep loading their cars with.) Considering that this 2nd gen Genesis was in its first model year, I had to marvel at how far they\'ve come and how fast they\'ve done it.\n\nI did think, too, Lexus was literally a trim-piece brand (and where are they now? First Place? or at least close to it) -- there weren\'t even any Lexi in Japan, they were all just called Toyotas. Now, look at Lexus -- a legitimate force to be reckoned with even if generally speaking some (OK most, OK, all) enthusiasts never have taken to them or seen them as anything more than sofas on wheels. Few, even the haters, laugh at Lexus now. And they actually brought that spunky little dude, the IS 350 F Sport to market and pantsed a BMW 335 (look it up, if you don\'t believe me.)\n\nIt would be hard to argue that both the top of the line Genesis, Equus and KIA cars aren\'t making ""don\'t look back, those headlights gaining on you are Korean"" type sounds.\n\nSo why isn\'t it possible for Acura to, likewise, kick butt and -- eventually -- regain some of its premium-ness? Of course, I don\'t KNOW, know, but I think, it is because they have found a niche where they have been and are successful, they make reliable and durable cars, their cars are in some pretty cool Marvel movies and the halo car has sex appeal. Have a cigar (and by the way, which one\'s Pink?)\n\nBy the way, I do think the NSX will be a great ambassador for the Acura brand, I just am not sure I see someone rushing in and buying an RLX based on the fact that the NSX wears an Acura badge. The gap between the NSX and the TLX or even RLX is unlikely to be narrowed by an oooober expensive sports car -- if you axe me.\n\nMean time, Genesis and KIA cars are quietly gaining ground and buzzing around the Premium Club members -- and you know what? Pretty soon one of them will sneak its way in and, then, well, there goes the neighborhood.\n\nHuman sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria!\n\nWhat next? Chrysler resurrects the Imperial?\n\nWe\'re headed for a disaster of biblical proportions.\n\nOh gawd.'","b""@markcincinnati\xe2\x80\x8c\n\n\n\nMy experience with the current crop of F30 3ers came when I brought my brilliantly balanced 328xi in for service. I drove a 328xi, a 320xi, & a 320xd. Nice cars. Very smooth riding. I'll even go as far as saying the 328 was MUCH faster than my inline 6's 230 horsepower. The chassis seemed to be stiffer. As an enthusiast, I just had little idea of what was going on. The car felt very disconnected.\n\n."""
b'March 2015',b'graphicguy',"b'My track days are over. But, I still like a good handling car. I\'m not nearly as critical between FWD/RWD/AWD as the current enthusiasts are. There was a time it made a difference (like running at mid-Ohio years ago). Just not so much any more.\n\nThese suspensions have become quite sophisticated. I do like the trick torque sensing rears of the Caddy, Audi, Acura. They truly allow rotation around any corner that really defies description.\n\nI also like the current trend of tubo/supercharging smaller motors to get more power out of less displacement. I had a Saab turbo in the \'80s. That one was ""hit the gas....wait for it....wait for it....BAM....steering wheel jerked out of my hand if I wan\'t holding on, and in the weeds you could go.

b'March 2015',b'roadburner',"b'I have to say that I really did like Acuras up until the ""Beak"" design theme emerged- the RSX in particular.\n\nAs for the Koreans usurping the German throne, I\'d think that won\'t be a possibility for some time. Having said that, I recall a column I wrote several years ago where I noted that the Optima Turbo was a very nice car- and while it definitely was not a sports sedan, neither was an F10 528i.\n\nI also draw a distinction between ""enthusiasts"" and those who are merely ""enthusiastic.""\nThe enthusiastic owner is like the person who gets behind a basketball team once they go deep in the NCAA Tournament- but is unable to name any of the starting five, never mind what position they play. There automotive counterparts are the owners with V6 Beamers; they think a port installed LSD is an intravenous hallucinogen and absolutely adore the electronic oil level sensor- that way they don\'t have to remember how to open the hood..\nIn contrast, an enthusiast at the very least knows the engine configuration of his/her car as well as which wheels are driven- and hopefully understands a few rudimentary handling terms.\n\nSad to say, I have noticed that several more ""mundane"" marques are attracting an increasing number of true enthusiasts- if not rabid gearheads. BMW seems intent on casting a larger net while using ""bait"" that is becoming more and more bland.'","b""I get people not liking the styling of the TL. Personally, I did like it. I thought it was bold and unique, which suited me fine.\n\nI've owned both the S4 and the TL SH AWD. TL SH AWD is mighty close to the Audi. No, the TL wasn't as fast as the S4, but it was every bit as adept in the handling dept and was very confidence inspiring to drive. It matched the S4 in the feature category. Service costs on the TL vs the S4 were miniscule in comparison. MPG was certainly better on the TL vs the S4, too. And, for the money I paid (under $40K) for the TL SH AWD Advance it offered huge value.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I liked my S4. Didn't like the reliability (lack thereof) of the S4 and didn't like the MPG, nor the maintenance costs, either."""
b'March 2015',b'markcincinnati',b'roadburner: Amen.',"b'The 2016 Acura ILX has a new engine and transmission, as well as several other improvements. Previously it wasn\'t very competitive at the entry level, but now I think it is. The most direct competitor is the 2015 Audi A3 1.8. Both are good cars, but here are few comparison points....\n\n2016 ILX base\n$27,900 msrp\n0-60: 6.2 (according to C & D)\nhp 201\ntrunk: 12.3\n8 speed DSG\n29 mpg comb\n\n2015 Audi A3 1.8\n$29,900 msrp\n0-60: 6.5 (C & D)\nhp 170\ntrunk 10\n6 speed DSG\n27 mpg\n\nEach one has advantages and disadvantages when it comes to standard equipment. The A3 has standard leather, standard XM in a better standard stereo, and split folding rear seats, none of which comes standard on the ILX.\n\nBut the ILX has standard the following things that I think are lacking on the base A3: moonroof, heated seats, LED headlights, rearview camera, smart entry/putshbutton start, USB port, 2 years longer power train warranty, Siri Eyes Free, etc.\n\nObviously somewhat difficult to compare, but I\'d say that the ILX standard things are ""worth"" substantially more to me than the standards on the A3.\n\nIf you add a moonroof, pushbutton start, heated seats, back up camera, etc. to the A3 then the price seems to inflate to c. $36k or so. But the Acura model that would compete with that would be the ILX premium which is c. $30k msrp. That is a significant price difference.\n\nThe Audi has a lot more prestige than the Acura, but the ILX is likely to be more reliable and have a lower cost of ownership than the A3.\n\nYes, the ILX is based on the Civic, but then the A3 is based on the Golf, and so I don\'t see much of a difference there.\n\nBoth are good cars, but I do think that Acura is back in the game with the 2016 ILX.'"
b'March 2015',b'graphicguy',"b'RB....I look at the Korean manufacturers more as a curiosity than anything else. I would like to get some butt time in a new Genesis, given that they\'ve supposed to have fixed the ""jittery"" suspension issues of the previous gen.\n\nThere seems to be this rush by BMW, Infiniti (with the Q), Mercedes to move closer to the middle, or to cast a bigger net, as you aptly put it. Audi has stayed pretty true to the luxury sports sedan mantra. And, a brand like Cadillac seems intent on taking care of the space that was vacated. In all frankness, I probably would have gone back to BMW after all the foibles with my S4. But, they transitioned into the F3x by then, and the drive to me was much less engaging with them. Plus, to get what I wanted, the prices really have sky rocketed on them to approx a $7K-$8K delta between my 335ix coupe and the just released 435ix equipped about the same way. Thanks but no thanks.\n\nI really have become smitten with the ride/handling engineering of the ATS/CTS. The Mag Ride Control is the real deal. Never thought I\'d say soemthing the size of my CTS as ""flingable"", but it is. It\'s just one of those cars that I look forward to driving every day....even love the looks of it....the quality of it...the build of it.\n\nStill, I would like to get some seat time in the new Mustang GT or the Challenger with the Scat Pack. Not sure when, or even if I\'d buy either. But can\'t say never. Never is a long, long time. It would be a 2nd (3rd?) car if I did.'","b""show previous quotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI only wish I was so rich that speeding tickets and the financial penalty of them didn't bother me one iota. Of course, they would still bother me on principle, but it would be nice to just be able to hire a lawyer for 3 times the ticket cost to fight them for me on that principal rather than waste my own time.\n\nAs for A8's, I think a lot of buyers that drive them with no passengers get them for the Luxury and not the sport side of the equation. Lots of room for the driver, a cushy ride, and probably more sound insulation from the world than an A6 would offer. The ultimate side of luxury from Audi. However, if I had enough money for a dedicated sport/track car, I'd probably settle in on an S6 as my dream everyday driver (and I have one child)."""
b'March 2015',b'markcincinnati',"b'Recently one (or more) of the ""big"" auto magazines (I think it was C&D) tested an old vs a new BMW. I assume the genesis of such a test was the ever growing brouhaha -- ostensibly from the faithful -- claiming the newer BMW\'s have lost some of their BMW-ness as BMW goes on the ""soich for more money!""\n\nIt seems, if memory serves, that the test reports demonstrated that the new BMW could better the old one in every significant (measurable) performance number.\n\nOnce again, since I am not, at this instant, in possession of the test report article, I could be mistaken. What I think I recall, however, is that despite the cries that BMW has forsaken the true believers, the numbers say otherwise.\n\nI had been a die-hard manual transmission guy. Our Audis -- with the exception of my brand new 1997 A8 -- had always been manuals. My maxed out allroad (2003) had to be special ordered -- not that I probably wouldn\'t have anyway -- since the dealer simply did not stock stick shifts even back then. I couldn\'t believe Audi would simply no longer offer its cars with sticks (for the most part). The 2001 or 2002 A6 2.7T could be had with a stick but the same model with a 4.2 V8 was only offered with an automatic.\n\nMy wife\'s 2005 X3 had to be ordered, too, since there were virtually no X3\'s on the dealer\'s lot so equipped. As I recall we couldn\'t even test drive a stick BMW period.\n\nWhen I got my 2005 A6, I knew I had probably enjoyed my last stick (the 2003 allroad 2.7T.)\n\nGoing on the hunt, I found that BMW did offer at least some stick shifts but there was little chance of finding one unless it was special ordered.\n\nI now have a 7-speed DSG in my \'14 S4. I, for the first time since 2003, don\'t miss the stick anymore.\n\nMost people -- that I know, excluding my wife -- don\'t even know how to drive a stick, so I don\'t see much value in complaining about that, and, besides, the DSG is so much better at shifting than I ever was and the shifts don\'t feel like they\'re robbing power from the engine.\n\nWhat we have today, if you believe Car & Driver (which I usually do), are better performing cars that have their performance characteristics available when you want them but invisible (for the most part) when you don\'t.\n\nYes, even Consumer Reports notes that an Audi [A6] is able to be sporty -- which I assume is somewhat of a statement that other brands (that they list) are not sporty.\n\nI\'m buying that today\'s fill in the blank (Audi, BMW, Mercedes & Porsche) automobiles are ""the best representations of sport sedans and CUV\'s ever on the market."" I\'m, therefore, rejecting the notion that the old ones were better performers than the new ones. The fact that the brands have become more accessible to folks who don\'t think like I thought -- up until 2005 -- simply means the brands have the power to sustain themselves in the marketplace.\n\nEven if I really thought a 10 or 12 year old M3 was somehow better than a new one, I am pleased that BMW has ""cast a wider net,"" for I fear had they not, they would be going or already have gone the way of the dodo.\n\nThe disdain so many have for sentimentality never ceases to amaze me -- my sentimental favorite car ever is my 1995 Audi S6 in pearl teal with a brilliant white leather interior. God I loved that car -- still have fond memories for it. It was, despite its being my favorite, no where near the car my 2014 S4 is -- the older S6 was, in perhaps every measurable way -- ""inferior"" to the new (or almost new) S4. My current S4 is the best car I have ever had, by a wide margin. I assume it would, in every measurable way, be crowned winna and champeen were it compared to the old S6 or even a last gen S4 (the one with the V8).\n\nThese cars that we talk about here and have strong opinions about are the best they have ever been (in every significant and measurable way). The fact that BMW or Audi now attracts folks who don\'t know that there isn\'t a V6 under the hood of their BMW is sad (for me at least); but, I would argue that the ignorant owner is just as desirable (as a customer) to BMW as the one who knows there is a turbo-charged inline-6 under the hood. In the end, car companies must put the soich for more money ahead of the soich for informed, appreciative and passionate customers. The way they go about selling more cars, however, is to build better cars that can be appreciated both by the true and pure disciples as well as the bourgeoisie.\n\nAlthough I don\'t think the Koreans are TODAY too much of a threat to the world-order, I don\'t think we should dismiss them out of hand. They are making very rapid advances -- pretty soon they may find entry into the Premium Class (and by pretty soon I think we should be very watchful of the evolution of their products for the next 5 or so years.) I remember the first Toyotas that were imported (back in the 60\'s) -- made in Japan was, then, not much of a threat. It didn\'t take long until they were nibbling at US made market share, then they just started taking ever bigger bites until names like Toyota, Honda and Datsun were forces to be reckoned with.\n\nI got into a new Genesis sedan -- it wasn\'t a Mercedes -- but honestly, I do think it was a very interesting attempt to convince ""you"" that it was worth a second look. Whenever the 3rd gen comes out, I would look for some serious suspension evolution which could go a long way toward making us take them more seriously.'",b''

b'February 2015',b'markcincinnati',"b'Assuming my comments are not banned: We have two Audi dealerships in Cincinnati. I have dealt with both of them, but purchased every one of our Audis from one dealership -- now called The Audi Connection.\n\nWe have two BMW dealerships, too. Purchased three Bimmers from one of them -- The BMW Store -- over the years.\n\nThese two dealerships -- the ones that we have purchased from have been wonderful to deal with from a sales perspective AND a service perspective. Out of more than two dozen Audis we have had, we did have one that was problematic (actually the brakes were the issue). Audi of America sent their area representative to help out the situation. As usual, the dealer was helpful in making such a thing happen.\n\nOK, I get it -- your mileage may differ. I agree with whoever said -- get rid of the bad ones (or words to that effect). No mfgr can tolerate even a very small number of crappy dealers. The Internet spreads the tales of woe like a Cancer. I know dealers are often local business people, not mega corporations -- although this is changing, in the era of the $1B dealership ""groups.""\n\nThe dealer can do harm, sometimes great harm to a brand -- and god knows Audi can\'t afford a sub-par dealer. No mfgr can.\n\nIf you need to buy or lease a new Audi and you are within 250 miles of Cincinnati, you can certainly buy one here -- but that probably does you little good with respect to service after the sale. You need a relationship with your dealer somewhat like your relationship with your ""barber"" (or hair dresser if you don\'t like the term barber). Of course, if you don\'t work at the relationship too, it won\'t pan out favorably, probably.\n\nMy Audi service mgr and I have been on a first name basis for perhaps 15 years -- our sales rep, in his mid-80\'s finally retired; he had been at the dealership since the discovery of dirt. Our new guy only has 12+ years with the dealer, he is so new he\'s still learning where the restroom is.\n\nThe time on the job of the various players at the dealership is a huge clue. If the lot tech guy and your sales rep have about the same tenure, you\'d be better off finding out the tenure, overall, of the reps. Ditto the shop people, shop foreman, service manager and service writers. My service adviser has been at the dealership for at least a decade.\n\nThe Audi Connection is the poster child for what a dealership should look like. The BMW Store has a similar tenure with its people and the dealer experience is all the better for it.\n\nIf you have a bad dealer, I do feel for you -- if you can, get the hell away from them.'","b""I have found that to have a great relationship with a dealer's service department, is simply to be nice.

I admired it back in the day.\n\nIn some ways perhaps the Germans are ahead of the 2016 ILX. For instance, the A3 seems to have nicer interior design. And the BWM 320i, of course, is sure to have better handling.\n\nBut the Audi A3 under the skin has a lot in common with a $20k VW Golf. That doesn't seem different to me than an ILX having some common bones with a $20k Honda Civic. They take these bones, reinforce them, put new skins on them, put new engines in them, etc. Well, I'm not so sure about the engine for the A3, now that I think about it. Isn't that basically the new standard Golf 1.8 turbo engine? Not sure.\n\nA turbo for the ILX might be nice, but I think the ILX 2.4 is already beating all of its competition with the base engines in terms of 0-60. And the competition isn't really weak, and so that seems plenty powerful enough for the likes of me.\n\nAnd when it comes to reliability and long term ownership, many would take an Acura over an Audi or MB. If you're just leasing and want the prestige, then the others are probably better choices. But if you're actually buying it for yourself and plan on keeping it, then Lexus, Acura, etc., might have an edge there.""",b''

She\'s the one who is willing to give the benefit of the doubt. Me? I don\'t care if it\'s my real estate agent, my stock broker, my car sales person, or even my landscaper,\n\nCar dealerships (and in turn, car manufacturers) expect me to live up to my commitment when buying a car to pull 10s of thousands of dollars out of my wallet for their product. I expect that they live up to their promise that the car will operate as they said it would. And, if it doesn\'t, I expect them to make it right without pushback. That last part is where Audi got in trouble.\n\nThe dealership Mark is referring to was actually at least moderately helpful, but still unwilling or unable (maybe both) to fix the car. Their Service Manager said the DSG trans and components of the Quattro system needed to be replaced. In a moment of unusual honesty, he said that Audi had a problem with some of the components for the drivetrain that were out of spec. He thought he\'d get the green light to do the repair. That authorization never happened. The service manager said at one point that the Regional Audi Rep told him the car was too expensive to fix. Not that it couldn\'t be fixed, but that he thought it costs too much to fix it. Really? I mean REALLY? Guess what? It was 4X more expensive to buy back and label the car as a corporate buy back.\n\nIt wasn\'t just me with the issues. One of the trade rags I read after they bought mine back, mentioned the same issue. I looked for recalls. Never saw any.\n\nThe Audi Customer Service people suggested I take it to the other Audi dealer in town. I have no proof, but I think they looked at it, test drove it, called the Region, got stonwalled and essentially just changed the trans fluid. Clearly, that wasn\'t the problem as it still existed as I drove it away from their service bay. Took it back to them a 2nd time. Can\'t remember what they actually did, but it didn\'t fix the problem.\n\nAt that point, Audi had the car for a total of about 6+ weeks. They came back and said lemon law didn\'t apply because I had the car in for two separate issues. It was the same issue, that needed two fixes....Quattro and DSG. I don\'t know what they thought....perhaps I was just going to forget about it?\n\nIcing on the cake....called Audi Customer Care (allegedly a Supervisor who had been assigned to my case), who proceeded to tell me the reason none of the local Audi dealerships would service my car, was because I didn\'t buy it from them. Uhhhhh.....izzatright? That\'s not what both of the Audi dealers told me. Game on. You\'re buying the car back, which they ended up doing.\n\nI told Mark\'s dealer what I thought could have/should have happened. They should have either replaced the trans and Quattro components. Or, they should have just swapped the car for one that worked correctly. Neither was offered....and believe me, I did ask. They wanted me to take a about a $10K hit to swap out the car, though. Yeah....that\'s really fair!\n\nAs far as the Caddy? I\'m not expecting the same resale percentage numbers I was used to getting with my Acuras 9which were exemplary). That said, I bought it right ($15K and change dff MSRP).

b'February 2015',b'graphicguy',"b'Mark....I think the Audi Connection could be a very good dealership. I think they were hampered by their Regional Rep. Plus, neither them nor the one on Beechmont could come close to the deal I got out of the Chicago Audi Dealership (Westmont). We\'re not talking about a deal that was a few hundred better....we\'re talking about a deal that was a few thousands as the delta (I think it was about $3K difference). I gave both the opportunity to get close...even gave them a little working room given I\'d save the time to drive to Chicago and back home again. The Chicago dealer bought me dinner and paid for a hotel room near their dealership. I can\'t even imagine either Cincinnati dealer doing that.\n\nWent to Dayton Audi store, too. They were more like the old ""let me get my manager to see if we can make a deal"". After waiting 30 minutes for this manager to show up, I left their store. Sales person tried to stall me more, but enough was enough.\n\nBMW Store is good. They never seem to have what I want. They have a pretty rigid set of criteria of cars they order from Stuttgart.

Yet on the RS7 they use the 8-speed Tiptronic. The stated reason is that the currently available DSG can't take the forces generated by the RS7's engine. The article said the S6 was on the cusp of stressing the DSG -- and owners of an S6 were cautioned not to after-market upgrade the HP and torque (which is quite possible with the turbo S6 V8, e.g.).\n\nCan the DSG in the S4 handle the upgrade you are contemplating and have a good long life? If not, what is the cost -- or risk in this upgrade?\n\nMy dealer says the S4 is going to have a horsepower and torque boost to keep it ahead of the standard V6T in the 2016 A6 line. It means, to me, that they have resolved the DSG issue; wonder if there is the headroom in the current DSG to take the upgrade is my concern."""

The suspesnion of the S3 just wears you out on anything other than glass smooth roads. The S4 would still be the way I\'d go, for the better suspension alone, but the S3 would make me think twice given the price difference.\n\nIf I had to go German, and I wanted a fast German sports car, I\'d probably save myself a lot of money and go with the Audi\'s younger sibling.....the VW GTI.\n\nOr, step up the ladder and pay all the money and get a 2/335ix.'",b'@kyfdx\xe2\x80\x8c\n\nYou sure can.'

So that is one reason. As for the warranty, well, stressing an engine just a little more and lasting through the warranty period isn't so tough. It is the longevity after the warranty expires that engineers can still concern themselves with. A particular car brand wouldn't sell too well if the majority of them self-destruct at 80k miles, for example.

b'January 2015',b'markcincinnati',"b'I\'m now at 22,000 miles on my \'14 S4 -- the car, in every way has been flawless. Oh, I need to correct that: the Audi Connect feature (free for 6 months) was great (when it worked) when I was ""in signal."" The thing is, someone at Audi of America made a deal with ""the fastest"" 3G provider (at the time) T-Mobile. However, at least in SW Ohio the coverage, at best, is poor-to-fair, and overall is 2G to poor. The screen indicator registers 2G about 1/3rd of the time (which renders the feature useless). Now, it is true that when T-Mobile is able to pump out true 3G it can be as good as what sometimes passes for 4G from some carriers.\n\nI had enjoyed using this feature with the voice command to verbally invoke ""Internet Destination, Morton\'s of Chicago"" or other destinations that would have normally had to have been found via calling 411, getting the number, calling the ""destination"" asking for the address and THEN entering it into the sat nav.\n\nThe thing is, the price for this service is $30/month -- which is galling since the TV commercials claim (for SW Ohio) 4, 4G LTE lines (family promo) for $100/mo.\n\nOf course, were I to buy a new A3, Audi Connect no longer uses T-Mobile.\n\nI\'d pay $10/month for this crappy (T-Mobile) service -- but $30 for 2G? No way.\n\nThe concept and the technology (in the car) make a lot of sense and when things work as expected (even in 3G) the execution is great (within a two block radius of a certain signal location). Swapping out the radio or ""unlocking"" the radio via software or some other method (the sim card?) would make my experience with this vehicle ""the best ever.""\n\nFor those folks who want driving performance, I can assure you the S4 (with the 7-speed DSG) is, let me see, effortless to drive, meaning that there is nothing (within reason) the car won\'t do without breaking a sweat. Another descriptive term: ""carve"" -- driving the car is as effortless as cutting warm butter with a hot knife.\n\nObviously, I am off-put by one little piece of tech that some folks who live in a strong T-Mobile reception areas probably can\'t relate to.

b'December 2014',b'graphicguy',"b'Sorry FN....just saw your question. Spent last week visiting wife\'s brother in San Francisco.\n\nI got the CTS AWD Performance version. The Magnetic Ride suspension is the real deal. Allegedly, the MRC is capable of infinitely changing the shock settings something like a 1,000 times a second, depending on road conditions. It has its own version of torque vectoring. These ""trick"" torque vectoring schemes really do improve the handling of these cars (as with the Audi S and TL SH AWD).\n\nIt smooths out the roughest roads, yet stays sharp when cornering and rotating. Like most cars in this class, the adjustable suspension is available. I keep it in ""Sport"", which firms the steering response (best version of electronic steering I\'ve used) and changes shift patterns. Feels much like a RWD based Audi Quattro or TL SH AWD.\n\nPut it in ""touring"" mode, and it feels much like a 4matic E class or an A6 Quattro.\n\nSport mode, while ""firm"" really doesn\'t describe the ride accurately,\n\nGreat seats, while not the sport seats in the TL SH AWD (which I loved), but certainly more ""sporty"" and comfortable than the hard, flat Mercedes seats. and not nearly as ""hard"" as the S4\'s.\n\nNot as speedy as an Audi S4, but quite torquey. Probably 0-60 in the 5 1/2 to 6 second range.....works for me. Probably more torque in the lower rev ranges than the TL....especially around town. It gets up and scoots to extra legal speeds in short order on the highway.\n\nAll the gee gaws. It took a few days to get used to CUE. But, now that I am, all the controls for it fall immediately to had once the proximity sensor senses your hand near the screen. Touch controls work. Instead of sliding the ""metal bars"", you realize those bars are only there to guide your fingers. You slide just above the metal bars.\n\nAll the chrome, wood, aluminum, suede, leather, etc is all real. Build and materials are all exemplary and as good, or better than anything in the class.\n\nFor reasons that befuddle me (and probably Cadillac, considering the accolades the car has received), the discounts were substantial on the CTS.

What used to be the CTS doing battle against the 3 and 5 series, the C and E class, the Audi A4 and A6, is now the duty of the ATS against the 3, C and A4, with the CTS doing battle against the 5, E, and A6.\n\nCTS moved up the ladder, with the ATS going against the cars we talk about in here.\n\nTheir President even admitted this isn\'t going to happen over night, but will probably take a couple of years.\n\nCadillac is in a unique situation where they don\'t seem to care about their ""traditional"" customer. I don\'t know if they ever would have snagged me unless the CTS were such a very good car to begin with.\n\nYou\'ll have the customer who bought a previous gen of the CTS and walk into the showroom thinking ""no way I\'ll spend $7K more for the new one over the old one."" Cadillac points them in the direction of the ATS and says....here\'s a better car than your previous CTS and it costs less. Some will get that. Some won\'t.\n\nHowever, if you want an even better car than the ATS, here\'s the CTS.\n\nAgain, it will take some time. And, some won\'t even like the way the new ATS or CTS drive, given they are more on the sports end of the luxury sports sedan/coupe market.\n\nBut, once they take hold, I think they have a very good foundation to build on to compete, and excel in both spaces.\n\nThey seem determined to do what it takes to get there. Good cars. Drive an ATS or CTS if you get a chance. They are very good sport luxury cars....almost getting to the point where tehy are filling the voids that Mercedes and BMW have abandoned.'",b''

Among price-competitive offerings, an all-wheel-drive 2012 Audi A6 with a supercharged V-6 engine sprinted from 0-60 mph in 4.7 seconds, while a 2012 BMW 535i checked in at 5.5 seconds, an all-wheel-drive 2014 Mercedes-Benz E350 at 5.8 seconds, and a 2013 Lexus GS 350 F Sport with a six-speed automatic at 5.4 seconds. Passing power from 45-65 mph is ample in the Genesis V-8, with a 2.6-second time not appreciably different from that of the last-gen Genesis V-8 (2.4 seconds), A6 3.0T (2.5 seconds), and 2013 GS 350 F Sport (2.6 seconds), but quicker than the 535i's 2.9 seconds and the 2014 CTS 3.6's 3.1 seconds.""","b'show previous quotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWOW even my El Cheapo 320 has this as part of the premium package.\n\nBTW, just had the El Cheap 320 coded, I now have the following:\n\nSport+ transmission\nPower folding side mirrors will open and close when locking and unlocking the car\nFog lights come on with the welcome lights\nIn motion DVD\nPanic Tail light, if hitting the brakes hard, brighter tail lights come on\nKey Fob is now coded to open and close all windows and sunroof\nturn signal blink 5 times instead of 3\nCar unlocks when ignition is turned off\n\nAll for $190 and have the file to re install if the dealership updates the firmware on the car.

I have had the experience where the GPS lady did indeed provide incorrect directions (but I still arrived at my destination, just with a long detour). The last time I had a car provide wrong directions was in 2004.\n\nThe ""science"" of GPS technology and the map makers themselves have improved greatly is the point.

b'December 2014',b'dino001',"b'I was recently browsing local inventory of BMW and Benz dealers. One thing jumped on me - new C-class is in stock in good number - NOT A SINGLE unit with leather seat in multiple dealerships. Even upscale C400. All have MB-Tex. BMW on the other hand - majority of 328 and up has premium package, which is leather. I really don\'t get it, especially that C-class is supposed to go ""upmarket"" as CLA filled the entry point. There are units there well in $50K+ and still no leather. I don\'t know - is that plastic MB-Tex so good? I just find it hard to believe... Not to mention that not a single one?'",b'So it seems that Acura is having issues with the TLX...'
b'December 2014',b'carnaught',b'In my experience the MB-Tex is so good that the only major difference to me is that the leather is more aromatic. Tex may be actually more durable but I have no anecdotal or other proof of this.',"b""While at the MB dealer we test drove a ML250 that had the fake stuff, at first I didn't know it was fake, it felt like leather, and the contrasting stitching really elevated the whole look.\n\nCG, I'm still not sold on the new CTS, having driving one a couple of months back over 600 miles I just couldn't get comfortable in it.

b'December 2014',b'markcincinnati',"b'The MB-Tex will eventually crack -- not the kind of cracks you can see in old leather, however.\n\nThe PLEATHER seats unlike real leather doesn\'t or can\'t breathe. Of course with modern seat ventilation technology, that may be less of an issue.\n\nI\'m still of the ""leather is better"" opinion -- but I remember ONE TIME ordering a new Audi 5000CS turbo quattro with wool seats (leather was standard and wool was a special order at no cost option). These seats, in many ways, were the most comfortable ever. Not cold in winter, not hot in summer (mine were heated, too).\n\nThe issue, with gray seats, was dirt. Well, OK, not ""dirt dirt"" but coffee, mustard, coke and other drinks, ice cream droppings and, I would imagine all sorts of other messes should one have kids in the car. A good old french fry stain would be a heart breaker.\n\nNow, I did put sheepskin seat covers on the front buckets -- and that helped.

b'November 2014',b'markcincinnati',"b'Some quick (for me) follow ups:\n\nEquipped pretty much to the max, the SQ5 (Prestige) will be in the $60\'s. A ""nicely equipped,"" but hardly Porsche equipped pretty much to the max will be close to $10K more. My Audi dealer says the Porsche will be almost $15K more ""similarly"" loaded.\n\nI don;t know how accurate that latter claim is, but the Macan S can easily go well into the $70\'s and the Macan Turbo can pass $100K -- but it will be about a half second quicker than the S and the SQ5.\n\nThe US SQ5 is also sold only with a set ground clearance, and the Macan is both lower and can be had with an adjustable suspension.\n\nThose who want more headroom, too, will consider the SQ5 since its proportions are more generous for rear seat passengers and their stuff. I thought the two cars were redundant, and I can still convince myself of that, but I can also see the Macan appealing to a different audience, but then, at the price, the Macan is now able to actually be more expensive than a Cayenne.\n\nI\'d test them both unless you have a specific purpose that only one or the other fulfills.\n\nThe SQ5 does have more HP and torque, and an 8 speed non-dsg transmission -- to the Macan\'s 7-spd PDK.\n\nBoth are very fine examples of excess -- in a CUV suit. We have 25,000 miles on our SQ5 -- and would get another in a heartbeat and we have driven both cars; we like the higher ground clearance of the Audi and the nearly $10,000 lower price is a plus too.\n\nThe S6, at its price, doesn\'t seem to have an analog from the other Germans. The BMW 535 doesn\'t even come close and the 550 isn\'t as sticky as the S6 (thanks to quattro).\n\nI can\'t really call the S6 a bargain, but it does offer the buyer more content for the MSRP than the BMW. I\'d avoid the 20"" wheels, but that is a personal choice.\n\nI floored the S6 and counted to 3 -- when I looked down I had gone beyond 100MPH from about 60. Nothing I\'ve driven (other than a Corvette) even comes a little bit close.\n\nThe S6, to me, seems just a bit too big, just like my S4 seems a bit too small -- so I look forward to a larger S4, although the S6 is my ""lust for"" car.\n\nThe least talked about ""car"" if you axe me, is the SQ5 -- it is a vehicle that deserves a bit more exposure. Too bad the Macan is likely to steal the show, being that it is, after all, a Porsche.'",b''
b'November 2014',b'brian125',"b""When I was at the Audi dealership I was talking to a guy getting a oil change on his SQ5. Absolutely loves this vehicle. Claims the ride and handling is phenomenal. price tag was up there thou. Didn't actually see one there.\n\nI find the S6 a little smaller inside for me. At 6'1 with 2 back surgery's under my belt and weighting closer to a quarter pounder with cheese area these days Car size, getting in and out is priority. In a perfect world I would love the S8 interior dimensions in the size of a S-6 but with a S6 price tag. That being said my dilemma which probably is not a bad one is replacing my 13, R-spec Genesis for a S6, or trading my 2012, BMW X-5 with 30k miles and buying the Q-7.\n\nI originally went to dealership to test drive the Q7 and wound up driving a 2015, S-6. I Love this vehicle or lust for it............ maybe both.. This car is the total package. So I'm either going for 2 shots in the ribs for a Hyundai trade in or 1 hard slap in the face for the X-5. I'm hoping my golf buddy takes my X-5 off my hands. Then my decision will be a lot easier.\n\nSuch problems around the holidays for us car lovers.

(all the while being as smooth as silk) like a Mustang V8 (circa 2012) \xe2\x80\x93 but the thing, as fun as it is to drive for a relatively short distance, just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like it is a Premium Class car (beyond the interlocking 4 rings on the front and rear) \xe2\x80\x93 it feels like what I imagine Subaru is shooting for and largely doing (but for a lot less money) with their current WRX's.\n\nThe Audi\xe2\x80\x99s 19\xe2\x80\x9d wheels and tires may well be the culprit, but the almost total lack of sound deadening (well, OK, not really) just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do it for me (especially when the thing is north of $50K). Getting out of an S3 and then driving off in an S4 is like night and day. The S4 may be more isolated, better at mastering road imperfections and designed to press your kidneys rather than punch them, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes even the \xe2\x80\x9cold\xe2\x80\x9d tech 2015 S4 still a bunch more car for just a little more money and the S4 actually feels and looks like the 4-rings suggest it ought to feel and look like.\n\nOh, BTW, the S3 has fantastic LED headlights \xe2\x80\x93 and the thing is a looker. But $50,000+? Nah.\n\n\nKeep on driving it like YOU live. I couldn't live with this car -- dammit!""",b''

I would think yes).\n=====\nHere goes:\n=====\n\nI\'ll stick with the A3 & A4 to introduce a new forum class for ""LPS"" [suffix\'d] cars.\n\nFor the moment, let\'s say the ELLPS class is solidly where the new A3 belongs, To me, that seems to suggest the A4 (and the 2016 A4 leaps to mind) is no longer an ELLPS, nor is it an LPS, since the A6 is the representative of the LPS entry from Audi.\n\nWell, two LPS classes used to be sufficient -- but over the past few years car companies have scrambled to ""find a hole"" in the market and create a new car model to plug it. And, no hole seems either too big or too little -- model proliferation is the norm these days.\n\nAudi and BMW (and Mercedes too) have become the masters of model proliferation, it seems.\n\nAnd, just about ""everybody"" demonstrates ""wheelbase"" [or overall length] and girth growth every time they birth the new generation of a model. The BMW 3, for instance, has grown so much so that it is, in many ways, larger than a not-that-old 5 series. The current A4 used to be the size of the new A3 -- and when the current A4 was introduced in the US as a 2009 model it\'s wheelbase was within a fraction of an inch of the size of the then current A6. I know, I had a 2005 A6 that I kept for 6 months after the lease ended so that I could move to the new A4 and not have any period of time where I was not in an Audi. When the 2009 A4 came in to the dealer, I pulled my A6 up beside it -- and it was virtually impossible to tell the difference between the two with respect to wheelbase.\n\nThe A4 got big! Then, when the new gen A6 came out, it, of course, grew in size -- the A3 was in the pipeline (not the 2009 A3, which was essentially a VW) and what we have in the brand new A3 is a car that plugs the hole left by the move up of the A4 into what used to be the size class of the A6, Numerous examples of this phenomenon can be cited for the cars that come from BMW, Mercedes, Cadillac and Lexus.\n\nWe now have -- at least -- 3 size (and price) categories for cars to fit into and still be, in some fashion (class) LPS cars. ELLPS, ILLPS & LPS is my proposal.\n\nILLPS means Intermediate Level LPS also known as a member of the phylum: Luxoperforiososedantis.\n\nSo, assuming we all accept the notion that three LPS classes are now appropriate, we move the current (and certainly 2016\'s upcoming) A4, 3 series and C class (while were sticking with the Germans) to the ILLPS forum and open up the new, \'blank slate\', ELLPS board (forum) for cars like the new Audi A3, BMW 2 series (which may be problematic since it doesn\'t have 4-doors as far as I know) and the Mercedes CLA (which is a 4-door coupe, according to MB). We move the CTS firmly to the LPS forum and put the ATS in with the ILPS cars if its wheelbase (among other things) doesn\'t force it into the ELLPS class.\n\nI would think wheelbase would be one criteria, total length and width of the car two additional criteria, base price and 90% maximum price yet an additional criteria, and so forth.\n\nWhich brings me to perception.\n\nI cannot -- YET -- place the Hyundai Genesis (for example) in the mix of LPS anything; however, there is a strong resemblance to some of the phylum\'s class members at least insofar as luxury content is concerned. I would assume the Genesis will be an LPS member someday.\n\nPerhaps time in the market is a criteria -- no one wants a poser -- and it takes time to earn your place in phylum Luxoperforiososedantis.\n\nIn any case, the time has come for the current ELLPS suspects to move to the ILLPS forum.\n\nAt least I think so.'",b'show previous quotes\nThe Intergra and RSX had no problems shaking the Civic stigma.'

As I enter the curve at 30mph, I accelerate hard as soon as the front wheels have passed the mid point of the curve.\n\nIf the car easily remains in its lane, I repeat the process at triple the posted speed.\n\nThe X3 easily handles this ""experiment"" and the feeling is that it could go at the corner at more than 3x the posted ""suggested"" speed. The RDX (old version with the turbo 4 and SH-AWD could do this all day.) The new one plows and crosses the center line.

If I see too much red painted on the Interstates (275 or 71), I know things are gonna be s=l=o=w so I take a secondary road route -- and I often try multiple routes and ask the navi lady to help me.\nI also ask the system to give me an approximate arrival time.\nHell, I play with all this stuff and wish there was more tech to assist me in my journey.\nTo each his / her own -- but the thing is, increasingly, the buyers of ELLPS\'s and LPS\'s take for granted that their vehicles will come with nav and a lot of other driver aids.\nI was in a meeting in Lexington KY (80 miles south of Cincinnati) the other day -- we were discussing an upcoming meeting and the client made the assumption that I would just input the address into the car\'s nav system (he knew not anything about my car), so he didn\'t give me directions, he just gave me the street and number of the destination to plug into my nav.\nA Garmin certainly works fine, folks often say they are superior to the factory systems (other than not being integrated with the rest of the car\'s ""avionics"".) It is just a preference (of mine) to have everything built in.\nHence my frequent close: Drive it like YOU live. I submit, however, that all of this tech will soon, soon, soon be standard and that there will be a bunch of new tech none of us have even imagined, yet.\nBesides, I wouldn\'t pull over and ask for directions or attempt to use a map, if threatened with pain and death.'",b'@justg0 said:\nI use Navi too - but not the factory installed as they get outdated and are not as good as Google Maps.

b'August 2014',b'markcincinnati',"b'My point regarding the new A3/S3 (which I have not driven, but have sat in) is that it will ""force"" the A4/S4 to move upscale in terms of luxury and it will also get more power so that the S3 will not be quicker than an S4.\nThe basis for my comments is the new C&D article where C&D says the S3 makes the S4 irrelevant or something akin to that.\nI have not seen the S3 yet -- but the A3 would probably receive the same comments -- this time aimed at the A4 -- from the author of the C&D piece on the S3.\nIf you accept that as having some truth to it, it would seem that Audi will be forced to do something to keep the A3/S3 from siphoning off customers from the A4/S4.\nMany folks buy/lease these cars and only the front seats see much adult duty -- the rear seats may be used by an adult, but probably only rarely. I think the A4/S4 is a bit cramped in the back seat -- so the A3, of course, must be quite cramped.\nBut, who cares if 95% of the time it is a driver and maybe a front seat passenger. Even those who take their colleagues to lunch probably would find no issue with the A3 for the often short drive from the office to the lunch wagon.\nWhat could the A4/S4 do -- add performance and/or add luxury -- and being that you\'re Audi, you would probably err on the side of adding lux first, performance second (my point about the S6 is that it is a far more ""muted"" sporting vehicle, emphasizing luxury first -- even though it IS a screamer performance wise.)\nThe 2016 A4 line will -- if history repeats -- not offer up an S4, rather that will come in MY 2017. But, even the A4 vs the A3 will have the A4 needing to be different enough from the A3 to justify the price. Size of the wheelbase, length, width, etc, alone is (and I\'m with C&D here) will not be enough to make the choice clear between the two -- the A4 will have to lead with more ""stuff"" more lux stuff and more performance than the A3 at any one point in time.\nPerhaps, the 2015 S4 will be more heavily discounted due to the birth of the S3 in the US next month -- get \'em while their hot for about a year.\nI may be wrong throwing my lot in with C&D, but I just can\'t see what the A4/S4 development team has as an alternative to the A3/S3 but to take the A4/S4 upstream, so to speak.\nPlease make your argument to the contrary, I would really love to think the A4 family can and will hold its own, will be differentiated sufficiently from the A3 to keep the A4 sales on an upward trajectory.\nI just don\'t see any alternative for the A4 but to head for the top (of course this will likely mean a stupid price delta will ""erupt"" between the cars -- something like I was lamenting regarding the price difference between an S4 and an S6.)'",b'@stickguy said:\nI sat in an A3 a couple of weeks ago.

Also how can Audi make it more Luxury? The A3 is about the same size as the first gen A4, so if the A3 is too small for some, the current A4 is bigger and roomier which would fit most people. One can get the same 2L turbo engine in the A3 as in the A4, I think the A4 should get a power boost, say in the 230-240hp range and keep the A3 at the current HP rating. Now for the S4, 333hp is not enough to make it faster then the S3 Audi can either increase HP or not worry about it.

But, then again, I might be right.\nThe comment somewhere, ""it\'s missing a pedal"" is one I personally relate to -- but, well that\'s two of us. Audi, BMW, et al, certainly WANT our money -- but there is probably very little (if any at all) financial reason to offer 6-speed manual transmissions any more.\nWe\'re lucky -- I think -- to have the wonderful 7-speed DSG unit that Audi uses in several of its cars, I\'m as fine as wine with that transmission. Heck, I\'ve even come \'round to the 8-speed tiptronic when tuned for performance shifting.\nAnd, even were I not happy with the 8-speed Audis and BMWs and the 7-speed unit employed by Mercedes, well, I really don\'t count much anymore.\nBMW is selling a lot of cars these days -- up over 12%. The super-majority of these sales, I assume, came with automatic transmissions. Good for BMW. Ditto at Audi and MB -- at least I assume so. It has been ""forever"" (2004 or 2005) since I saw, let alone drove a manual transmission at an Audi or BMW dealership. My last stick was an Audi allroad -- 2003 model.\nMy wife\'s last stick was a 2005 BMW X3 3.0. Since then we\'ve had a 2005 A6, a 2008 X3, an Infiniti 2011 FX35, a 2009 Audi A4, a 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD and now a 2014 S4 and SQ5.\nIn this (the examples of the cars we\'ve owned) one way, our buying probably represents more of what most ""real"" people actually buy. Although I would argue that those who buy Audi\'s S and RS cars and BMW\'s M\'s, and Mercedes AMG\'s no matter how poshed-up, may not be the manufacturers\' main, or primary customers.\nIf BMW 3 series cars really have fallen out of favor with many of their previous customers, I would agree (with whoever posted this idea) that for every ""die hard Bimmer-file"" that leaves the fold, several new to the fold customers come on-board.

I presently drive an Acura TSX from the pre-beak era with a very nice manual transmission that drives the wrong set of wheels. It\'s been stone-reliable (well, there was the blower motor issue that I dealt with a month or so ago) for the whole time I\'ve driven it (approaching 100K miles), but I\'ve never forgiven Acura for not bringing in the diesel TSX that was promised for the model year following my purchase of the gasser that I drive.

Take for example the windshield wipers. BMW perhaps makes one of the best wipers in the business. The rain-sensing wipers have never let me down even during driving in heavy rains at 80-90 mph because the vehicle is designed from the ground up to be driven fast. Same goes for my headlights which are bi-level xenon. With my poor eyesight and sensitivity to glare, the BMW is the only car I take out at night because they make absolutely wonderful auto-dimming exterior and interior mirrors. Even the seat belt assist (who I lovingly refer to by name) has an intelligence to it and does not extend if there is no one in the passenger seat, the door is not closed, or if the car is in Drive. These are subtleties and design elements that still make, in my opinion, the German cars stand out from Japanese counterparts.\nSorry for the long post.'",b'@circlew said:\nAnybody have any feedback on the 335is?

b'June 2014',b'wayne21',"b'I plan to wait until the 2015s are out (TLX and Maxima) to seriously car shop, but I was out of town today and stopped by an infiniti and an acura dealership to just check out their cars. Not to test drive them, but was interested in the ease of entry/exit (a very important issue for the wife) and the interior appearance. Infiniti Q50 - nice that the passenger seat elevates! I think wife may be able to get in/out without any difficulty. It was a base model and I thought the interior was fine in spite of the vinyl (I would pay the extra for leather). It\'s been awhile since I looked at an Altima, but I don\'t think the Q50s interior was any nicer (maybe not even as nice) than the top of the line Altima. I also didn\'t understand why there was a spare tire taking up such a large portion of a small trunk in a car that has run-flat tires. But I realize the idea behind the Q50 isn\'t a ""nice interior"". I had read a number of sites that talked about an odor in the Q50 when left in the heat. I looked at one on the showroom floor (not in the heat) and didn\'t detect anything. It\'s a car I could own.\nThen to the acura dealer just for a look. Looked at the TL with tech package on the floor. I was not impressed. I hope the TLX has a nicer interior. I thought the leather surfaces were nice, but I thought the materials used elsewhere on the interior were pretty cheap - a lot of hard plastic! The passenger seat elevated which was nice to see, but it seemed that in elevating the passenger seat it would be a bit harder to get in and out (harder than the Q50). I think it was the layout of the dash that forced me to move the seat all the way back to get it in that may make it hard for my wife to get in/out. Will wait until seriously shopping and have the wife try it out in the TLX. I am no fan of dealerships adding things to the car and this particular dealership adds about $3,000 to each sticker. I may be off by the individual numbers, but it was $500 for theft marking (if someone steals my car I don\'t want it back!), $700 to wax the car and spray the interior with scotch guard (I prefer turtle wax ice sealant and my own scotch guard - about $15 for both - and unlike the high school kid working for them that doesn\'t care about my car, I will do a good job and not miss anything), $750 for wheel locks, mud guards and a rubber mat in the trunk (a mat I wouldn\'t want in my car) and some other overpriced stuff I wouldn\'t be interested in and wouldn\'t pay for. I would pass on the car before paying for any of those things.\nIf I had to choose between the two, it was a no-brainer. It would be the Q50. I don\'t think I would even be interested in the TL. But once the TLX and maxima are out I\'ll seriously shop. Just one person\'s opinion... the guy that\'s going to pay for it. Not trying to step on anyone\'s toes or insult anyone. My wife is most interested in something that not everyone has. We bought a Toyota venza in 2010 and that was one of the reasons for purchasing it (as well as incredibly easy entry/exit for her). The people two doors down from us bought the same green venza. At church, we have 4 green venzas and 1 white venza (ours and the white one are the only 6 cylinders) and 3 of the green venzas (1 of which is ours) park side by side at the church (handicap parking)!'","b""@wayne21 said:\nThank you, markcincinnati.

b'June 2014',b'markcincinnati',"b'wayne21: I very much enjoyed most of the experience of owning an 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance. I had added the rear parking sensors and the ""factory"" splash guards to the car and I, to this day, call my TL, my ""Honda S4"" or my ""Acura S4"" -- the car must\'ve come with 3-bent wheels, which may be the reason I thought the brake rotors were warped and had them turned three times (all under warranty).\nOnce the wheels were replaced (with a 50% credit from Acura), the car was smooth and the brakes didn\'t chatter or feel warped in any way.\nI got the idea to call the TL my ""Acura S4"" not from an original thought, but from an Automobile test report where the S4 and the TL were compared even though the report observed most folks would probably NOT cross shop the two cars (they were some $11,000 apart, too -- the Audi was more expensive, of course).\nI got tired of the Acura feeling about 90% of what I had hoped it would be -- which is actually a compliment considering I was comparing it to a car that was about 25% more money.\nIn any case, my Audi dealer (who is also an Acura dealer, go figure) made me a deal I couldn\'t refuse once he found out I had ordered a new Lexus IS350AWD F-Sport. Bought out the Acura lease (less than a year to go as I recall) and gave me a discount of 6% off the sticker of a new S4 configured exactly as I wanted it.\nAt the same time, my wife\'s Infiniti (2011 FX) was also coming off a 39 month lease and, yes, you guessed it, the Audi dealer (also an Acura dealer) is also an Infiniti dealer and once they got wind of my wife\'s tap dancing with a new BMW X3, made her an offer on a new Audi SQ5, that she couldn\'t refuse.\nDuring our shopping adventure, we test drove the daylights out of all the usual (and some unusual) suspects.\nI oh so wanted the Q50S/AWD to be the ""it"" car for the 2014 MY. It was good, maybe almost very good -- but for the money that I had to pay for the 2014 S4 I ended up with, I couldn\'t do it. BTW, probably not gonna make any friends, but I think I\'d rather have the Q50/S than the 3 serires BMW we tried.\nIn any case, I want to be supportive of your pre-decision to go with the new \'15 TLX SH-AWD, the Acura\'s can still make (for me) a pretty good value case, even if they are kind of an ""S4 lite.""'","b""@roadburner said:\nSorry, that's what I get for writing and watching TV at the same time..."""

I had seen those sights before when googling wind noise and acura. My wife doesn\'t want another Toyota (we have a 6 cyl venza) or Honda (had an accord). I had a 2000 accord and it had tons of wind noise. In 2005, I looked at an accord (knowing about wind noise) and the wind noise was very obvious to me on each one we test drove so we bought a ford. In 2010, I test drove a couple accords and could hear wind noise on the test drives (ez to do when you actively listen for it) so we bought a Toyota. I have test driven and ridden in a few new accords (close friend has a 2014) and can hear the wind noise (my friend hears nothing). Wife doesn\'t want another ""car that everyone else has"" so I thought we\'d step up. I know a number of people with acuras and when I ask them about wind noise they all say yes it is noticeable, but tolerable. I\'m not interested in hearing wind noise. I\'d think Honda could figure out how to build cars without wind noise.\nCars I\'m considering - Acura TLX (agree on the first year model thing, but thought it to be a worth a look - just the wind noise issue associated with acuras/hondas), Infinit Q50 (don\'t care for the option packages I have to buy to get what I want), and the pending 2015 maxima (a significant update that I don\'t know much about, but my wife likes the looks of the car). I might even consider a Hyundai genesis sedan. The venza runs great and we\'re not in a hurry, but if the right ""upscale"" car comes along I\'d buy it.

Conversely, other people cannot even comprehend why somebody would buy something like filltheblank because there is another filltheblank just as good (in their eyes, anyway) and cheaper. And it\'s all good.\nThere is another type of discussion we have here constantly - does filltheblank belong to ELLPS? Honestly, I don\'t really understand why people get so worked up if it does, or does not. Many people would cross shop cars that are not the same ""category"", so what... The line will always be blurred and they move. Yesterday\'s luxury is today\'s standard. Yesterday\'s benchmark of sportiness (like manual transmission) is becoming so rare that it\'s impossible to use as an actual measuring stick. Prices go up incessantly, so yesterday\'s 30K car is today\'s 40K. And so on. If somebody cross shops Ford Focus ST or Subaru WRX/STI with BMW 328i and somebody else cross-shops Lexus ES (not even IS) with same BMW, who am I to say they are ""wrong"" about looking at them?

There is bunch of former ELLPS, but they got so diverse that it\'s too wide. Some lost ""Entry Level"" pricing (long time ago, I might say), others lost performance, others went beyond ""Entry Level"" luxury.

b'June 2014',b'qbrozen',"b""I ran JB4 by itself for a while. (Then camber plates.) It was Ok for a few months, then started triggering limp mode once a week or so. Dealer replaced coils, plugs, and fuel pump (this was the car's second fuel pump) across 3 different trips for the limp mode problem. Seemed OK for a little while again.\nAfter 1 track event where the car was plagued by overheating, I added a custom larger oil cooler and downpipes (thought maybe deleting the cats from so close to the engine could help with heat). But then the vanos solenoid problems began. While on my 3rd set of those, the car started making some very disturbing but faint noises from down deep within, so I gave up, quickly removed the downpipes and tuner, and traded her in. Total ownership period was 18 months.\nWith the JB4 by itself, I think they were claiming 340-350 hp, IIRC. With the DPs, it should have been somewhere in the 370hp range. Some folks were pushing far more through the N54 engine, but I didn't feel the need for that much. It was damned quick, and a great deal of fun when running right. I'm pretty sure, even in stock form, though, it wouldn't have been a reliable car in the long run.""",b'@markcincinnati said:'

Hard core rally guys could probably care less as all they really care about is does it run and is it fun to drive. But when one positions the discussion to talk about entry level LUXURY PERFORMANCE sedans then at least a moderate level of luxury should be expected or we might as well include Mazda6s and Honda Accord V6 in the discussion. Luxury cars are not strictly delineated by the car but by the dealer, warranty, service etc that also comes with the purchase of luxury nameplate.\nThe reason why many on here were opposed to the TSX being included here was that it didn\'t seem to have the performance side nailed down. However, it did have the luxury side nailed down pretty well as most of the things recently mentioned came standard on it.\nI think when you buy(and pay extra for) a luxury car from a luxury nameplate there should be somewhat of a basic standard which one can expect without having to option the vehicle up to the hilt just to reach the standard that most other luxury brands start off with. Some here almost come across as denigrating those that do like a little luxury with their auto by making statements like ""if it doesn\'t come with it I don\'t need it or if I don\'t need it to shift gears, what good is it"".

Son thinks it's cool...\nAt least the Jaguar shifter is relatively easy to figure out, although I'd dread the day when the car fires up but the knob refuses to elevate.\nI remember the year BMW introduced the beer tap; at the BMW CCA Oktoberfest BMW NA had several test drive cars and the BMW reps running the show had to spend a minute or two with each member before their drive explaining how the shifter worked. That is just ridiculous. Aside from the space saving justification given earlier no one has been able to explain how the beer tap is superior to a conventional automatic shift lever.\nI would not be surprised if BMW's designers get bored and decide to steal a page from Ford's Edsel playbook- and put all the shift controls on the steering wheel hub...""",b'@robr2 said:'

So right there you are talking $2250, this will cover fee\'s and first month payment, and a slight cap reduction (remember all this is ZERO out of pocket.) then add 7 MSDs, so basically you could just walk into the dealer, with $3500 and walk out with a payment of $540/m on that 50K car, and at the end of your lease get that $3500 back. Those 7 MSD\'s well save you roughly $50/m x 36 = $1800. So you could walk into and have a cap reduction that doesn\'t cost you a cent but helps to lower the payments slightly. When I did my deal on my 320, I was very temped to lease since BMW was giving me 2K built credit and 1K for my grad degree, a total of 3K, plus add $2400 for 7 MSDs, my payments would have been $280/m.'",b'@nyccarguy said:\nsweendogy\nCongrats on the S4!

I am a manual trasmission guy, my current and last three cars have had manual transmission, but diesel engine is probably LEAST fun and LEAST suitable with manual trasmission for a passenger car (it\'s a little different for towing vehicles and tractor trailers with 10-12 gear manuals used to crawl uphill or just maximize efficiency).\nThis holiday I drove again (just like last year) my dad\'s Audi A4 with 1.9 TDI and manual transmission (it has sports suspension, too) and it was not a fun car, not to me anyway. The reason? Simple - diesel powerband is so narrow and short that I had to constantly shift up and down even on straight roads (just slight speed variation made it uncomfortable, if the car was on wrong gear). Ramp merging was a bit less scary than last year (as I got used to it and learned a little), but nevertheless couldn\'t hold a candle to a nice gasoline engine of similar power (even lower torque), when you can keep your car on same gear up to 5K+ rpm and keep accelerating. Diesel nicely kicks the speed up, but then equally suddenly dies in the middle of the manouver making you shift at least comfortable moment and lose time/distance.\nIf there is one type of passenger car that I don\'t mind well spaced and timed multigear automatic (or CVT), it is exactly small diesel.

b'January 2014',b'dino001',"b'@m6user:\nWell, I guess, our priorities are simply different. I\'m sure it probably lies in one\'s definition of ""fun"" and what each of us considers a good experience. My point of reference for MT experience are good gasoline engines with long powerbands and decent torque (WRX, STI, 328), to which diesel simply cannot hold a candle in terms of driving satisfaction. I talked to many owners of diesels in Europe and ""fun"" is not even in their vocabulary. Their reasons of getting diesel is plain and simple - money.\nI consider current 328d a first BMW\'s legitimate entry in terms of economizing fuel efficiency, Such consideration was not as important in the past, but I guess times change, more and more marginal customers buy those things, so lowering their cost of ownership is one way of expanding the market opportunity. I think the 8AT is just right for it. I don\'t think 6MT would be any better in terms of driving experience and it would not provide any fuel economy savings. It might provide potential for better durability, but I didn\'t hear of massive failures of those BMW\'s autos. I may be misinformed, of course.\nThe background of European popularity of diesel does not lie in its inherent ""fun"", or otherwise superior performance. It is a plain fuel economy advantage traded for clunky sound, higher noise, lower powerband. The diesel engines went long way from times when they were very slow and had unbearable vibrations. Today\'s turbos fixed that off-line acceleration problem - in fact the punch provided by diesel is better than gasoline - the only thing is it doesn\'t last. The maintenance seems to be more of an issue today, that\'s the price paid for better engine. The engines reportedly do not last as long as they used to, they are more sensitive to fuel quality, which can be a problem in certain areas and repair costs are massive. To be fair, that\'s true about all cars, not just diesels.\nIn the world of $8-10/galon fuel (today\'s prices in Euro zone), every drop counts, so getting your car going further has real financial consequences, even for more affluent people. Only richest of the rich don\'t have to factor that in, the rest needs to consider if the great gasoline V6/I6, so popular with many Americans (not to mention V8), is affordable. Memo: it is not. Thus, the second and real only choice becomes a decent diesel. Prior recent boom, diesel fuel was also considered a lower grade byproduct and it was taxed less, creating a double bang for a buck (higher mpg on lower priced fuel). That advantage is gone now and one can already see the trend not as strong as it used to be.'","b""@graphicguy said:\nThese are shaping up to be some pretty hot cars if all this comes to pass....especially if Acura doesn't goose the price, which we're assuming they won't given they're trying to attract both the TSX (now discontinued) crowd and the current TL crowd."""
b'January 2014',b'markcincinnati',"b'Regarding Diesels & Transmissions post (above):\nI suppose there is some chance that the manual transmission ""option"" will soldier on, probably for several more years. However, the manual transmission is, sadly, on its death-bed. Sadly? Sure, sadly -- because manual transmission cars (or more accurately said ""some"" manual transmission equipped cars) generally speaking are more fun to drive; and, until recently manual transmission cars provided real, measurable benefits simply unavailable with even the best transmissions that shift(ed) themselves.\nToday, however, the manual transmission crowd, of which I consider myself to be a member, really doesn\'t have any attribute (that can be measured) that makes it ""better"" than some automatics. And, the thing is, even those automatics which are inferior -- today -- to a stick-shift, will likely soon be replaced with incrementally better autos until virtually all the automatic transmissions on the market are equal to or better than manuals.\nThen, as a natural progression, all automatics offered will render manuals measurably inferior -- leaving only ""fun-to-drive"" as their reasons for being. Of course, in the ELLPS and LPS world, at least, manuals will simply no longer be offered as the upcoming crop of drivers is both unfamiliar with manuals (read: unable to drive them) and really confused as to why anyone would even want to shift a car.\nWe are progressively moving toward the autonomous automobile -- at least if you believe the story on CBS\'s Sunday Morning program where the new autonomous technologies were put on display courtesy of Mercedes (and Volvo and, and, and).\nManual transmissions, like light beers, are dead and they just don\'t know it yet.\nI used to jump in a cab in Munich (often a light yellow Mercedes) and most of the time it was a manual transmission diesel version of the MB E Class. These days -- well since 2005 -- most of the cabs are as noted but with automatic transmissions. My assumption is, this can be seen as a bellwether -- either a predictor or cause-agent of things that will ""soon"" be adopted universally.\nMy 1995 Audi S6 was ONLY available with a manual transmission; I can\'t even imagine a 2014 S6 so equipped -- and, frankly, despite my ""fun-to-drive"" comments, I can\'t even imagine I would want a 2014 S6 with a manual trans.\nHow many of the ELLPS and LPS cars on the market are even offered with an ""optional"" manual transmission? Or perhaps the more pertinent question is what is the % of manual transmission versions of these ELLPS and LPS cars that are sold (at least in the US, anyway)? I would be pleasantly shocked to hear almost any number greater than 2%. The economics of offering an auto and a manual version are, likewise, already in play -- if a German manufacturer has to certify both a manual and an auto version of a model to be able to sell them in the US (and elsewhere, I\'d imagine), my guess is they will simply decide there is no economic justification for certifying a model that represents but a tiny portion of sales, no matter what we say here, or no matter what the editors and writers of Car & Driver, et al, [non-permissible content removed] about.\nI\'m so happy with my S4\'s 7-Speed S-Tronic (""automatic manual""), I really don\'t even miss the stick shift. I did, however, test drive the 2014 S4 with a manual, and I must say it sure was ""fun-to-drive"". I\'m over it now, however.

The idea of the twin turbo 6 has to do with the CAFE numbers, but since the 320, 328i and 328d are all exceeding their EPA rating, we might see more fun cars from BMW...\nLike you graphic, the M235i has caught my eye, for under 50K you can get yourself a car that is really a M2 (full M suspension, and other go fast items) with the turbo 6 with the performance pack standard. And with the huge aftermarket for that turbo six the sky is really the limit.

That IMO will make it a much more desirable option since it will be plenty quick. Keep the 2.0l for the base car, and have the 2.4 as the upgrade.'"

b'January 2014',b'markcincinnati',"b'The new Acura TLX (and the press release comments) give me hope for the brand. I am going to assume the engineers and designers at Acura have banished as much of the ""Honda Effect"" as possible. I see no harm in some power train sharing, for example, but Acura needs to be a brand that stands out as a Brand, not just an upscale Honda.\nFor years (and I know since I owned examples of both brands), it was quite easy to see the resemblance and lineage of Audi and VW. I assume it was Audi who made the decision to ""go their own way"" not the other way around. The result has been beneficial to both brands.\nThe new Q50 (recently reviewed -- and not all that favorably -- on MotorWeek) got the style right as far as I am concerned. The 3.7L engine has been made to feel much smoother and the interior is more upscale befitting Infiniti\'s aspirations. Thus far, however, the reviews of the Q50 have been, well, underwhelming. I suspect the driving dynamics that the experts loved in the G37 will need to return and be improved upon sooner rather than later.\nThe IS from Lexus -- in IS 350 F Sport trim -- seems to have gotten everything right, not so much however the lesser IS\'s, especially the 250 which has recently been given mostly ""thumb\'s down.""\nNow, along comes Acura with what appears to be a sparkling, spanky new TL(X). Acura, for the past few years, has been apparently wandering aimlessly (with the exception of the MDX, one of Acura\'s \'reasons for being\') -- are they a Premium car-line or are they drifting further away with each passing year (a halo car, which is looking good, ain\'t enough to redeem them, yet). This new TLX is, from the web pictures a looker -- and the marketing message is pretty darn strong. Like the Q50 and the IS 350 F Sport, however, the proof will be when the automotive press gets their hands on the thing in several states of trim.\nDespite my ""one and done"" Acura TL SH-AWD flirtation and my subsequent return to Audi (with an S4 none the less), I did think the Acura was a decent attempt at creating an ELLPS; I still think the 2012 and newer Acura TL SH-AWD models were Acura\'s S4, and a high value vehicle, too.\nSo, here\'s hoping Acura\'s glintzy (a made up word) new TLX lives up to our expectations as well as its press release. As Van Morrison said (adapted here to mean ""These are the days to be in the market for a new ELLPS""):\n""These are the days, the time is now\nThere is no past, there\'s only future\nThere\'s only here, there\'s only now.""\nGet \'em while they\'re hot.\nAnd, drive it like you live.'",b'@flightnurse said:\nAll the info you want and more... and yes you can now build one on BMW website'
